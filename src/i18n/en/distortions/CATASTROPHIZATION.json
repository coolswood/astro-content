  "dialogSummary": "In this conversation, Person 1 catastrophizes their situation after receiving a rejection from a job interview, assuming it means all future job searches will fail. They’re ignoring the option of continuing their search and revising their expectations, which might lead to a more constructive, realistic outcome.",
  "dialog": [
    "I was turned down after a job interview. That means I'll never get hired anywhere and I'll be jobless forever.",
    "But you’ve applied for other positions, right?",
    "Yes, but what’s the point? If I couldn’t land this one, clearly nobody wants me. Every attempt is pointless.",
    "That kind of outlook may only make things worse. Maybe it's time to reconsider your expectations and keep looking with a fresh approach.",
    "But how do I move past that failed interview? It feels like proof I won’t get hired anywhere, that all my plans have fallen apart."
