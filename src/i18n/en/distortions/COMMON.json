Rather than objectively reviewing the reasons, we often say things like, “I always show up late” or “I can never be on time,” ignoring all the times we arrived promptly.</p><p>This mindset can diminish self-confidence, foster pessimism, and intensify anxiety or depression. Recognizing these thoughts and replacing them with more balanced, realistic ones is crucial for maintaining emotional health and a clearer view of reality.</p>",
  "dialogSummary": "Person 1 is upset about being late to a meeting and overgeneralizes their time management skills. Person 2 encourages a more objective view, pointing out occasions when Person 1 was on time and stressing that a single late arrival doesn’t define someone as always being late.",
  "dialog": [
    "I can’t believe I was late again. I always run late. I have no time management skills whatsoever.",
    "Wait, don’t jump to conclusions. Think about how often you’ve actually been on time. Does one late arrival really mean you can’t manage time at all?",
    "But lately, I have been running late more often. It feels like I’ve lost control entirely.",
    "Let’s be rational. Being late once doesn’t make you perpetually late. Maybe there were unexpected factors you couldn’t control."
