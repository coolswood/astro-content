Instead, we focus on flaws and negatives, dismissing real successes and achievements—even when they’re significant.</p><p>This can show up in many areas: work, relationships, health, or personal growth. For example, someone might achieve professional recognition but dwell on small mistakes instead of taking pride in their accomplishment. Or if someone receives a compliment, they may shrug it off as unimportant or unearned.</p><p>Underestimating your own positives can make you doubt your abilities, erode confidence, and lead to dissatisfaction or even depression. Learning to spot and truly appreciate the good things in your life, and allowing yourself to celebrate your achievements, is critical for a healthier mindset.</p>",
