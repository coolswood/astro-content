For example, after a tough interview, a person might dwell on the rejection instead of recognizing the lessons or useful information that could help in the future.</p><p>This distortion often leads to dissatisfaction and discontent, even when there’s plenty of good in life. Mental filtering commonly appears alongside other distortions like black-and-white thinking or discounting the positive.</p><p>To overcome mental filtering, it helps to notice and appreciate positive moments and ask yourself what positive aspects you might be missing.</p>",
