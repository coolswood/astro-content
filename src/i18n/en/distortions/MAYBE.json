  "dialogSummary": "In this dialogue, Person 1 uses “What-If Thinking” to justify failing an exam, shifting blame to external factors. Person 2 tries to guide them toward present possibilities, emphasizing that the past can’t be changed and it’s more helpful to focus on what can be done now.",
  "dialog": [
    "I failed the exam. I should’ve studied more.",
    "But you had a job every day. You did what was possible under your circumstances, right?",
    "Yes, but if I hadn’t been working so much, I could have studied more.",
    "Keep in mind that the past can’t be undone. It’s more productive to think about using your time effectively moving forward, rather than dwelling on what could have been."
