  "textHTML": "<p>Black-and-white thinking is a cognitive distortion that pushes us to view the world solely in extremes: everything is either perfect or disastrous, people are angels or demons. This perspective overlooks the rich variety of nuances and the depth of any situation, boiling everything down to a stark “black or white” mindset. It greatly limits how we see reality and narrows the range of possible solutions.</p><p>Examples of black-and-white thinking include sweeping judgments about yourself or others, such as “I always fail” or “he’s always wrong.” It can also appear in polarized opinions about events, objects, work, relationships, politics, and more.</p><p>Such thinking can lead to serious issues like stress, anxiety, depression, social isolation, and relationship problems. That’s why recognizing this distortion and cultivating more flexible, well-rounded thinking is vital. It helps us face reality more effectively and make more balanced decisions.</p>",
