    "Rate your well-being before and after completing CBT exercises. We recommend assessing daily to monitor the progress of your well-being.",
    "This feature is at your discretion, but we suggest two approaches:",
    "First, assess in the morning. Throughout the day, engage in CBT exercises, conduct experiments, and have sessions with your therapist. Then, reassess your well-being in the evening.",
    "Alternatively, evaluate right before starting activities in the app or a session with a psychologist, and then rate again immediately after completing the exercises.",
    "Both options are valid. Choose the one that suits you best."
