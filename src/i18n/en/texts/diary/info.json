  "event": "Let's start by identifying the trigger that caused negative thoughts or emotions. The trigger can be an utterly insignificant event or even your own thought.",
  "thought": "Automatic thoughts are generated by an event and lead to the emergence of negative emotions. Emotions, in turn, cause a deterioration of the state and the emergence of new automatic thoughts. This results in a cycle of negativity, which is difficult to break out of. To prevent its occurrence, identify the automatic thought as soon as possible and record it in a journal.",
  "body": "Try to return to the moment the trigger occurred. Remember what unpleasant sensations were present in the body at that time.",
  "behavior": "What was your behavior afterward? What did you do after you experienced negative emotions?",
  "response": "After identifying the automatic thought, it is necessary to pay attention to it and reflect on it. As a rule, automatic thoughts contain logical errors and distortions. Your task is to provide a rational response to the distortions and form a new mindset.",
  "conclusion": "Describe the outcome of your work - how your emotions and thoughts have changed, what you plan to change in your reactions if a similar event occurs.",
  "comparison": "Give arguments supporting your automatic thought and arguments refuting it. This will help you understand how objective and real it is."
