    "The MindHealth team says hello! We’re a small but very inspired crew – and yes, everyone you see in that photo really does fit into one shot.",
    "We’re a couple based in Finland. Daniil is the developer who has personally written every line of code in the app. Sofya is the designer who makes sure MindHealth is not only beautiful, but also intuitive to use. And in the middle is our little source of inspiration, our bearded dragon Toothless, who manages to make us smile every single day.",
    "Alongside us, there are professionals who support the project in specific areas: psychologists, content authors and other specialists. We invite them in to make sure the content in MindHealth is both high-quality and trustworthy.",
    "We’ve walked our own difficult path with depression, and that experience is one of the reasons MindHealth was born. We wanted to build a tool that helps people move through tough times a little more gently and with a bit more confidence.",
    "We created this page to be a little closer to you. If you’re curious, we’ll gladly share updates about how the project is evolving and small moments from our everyday life.",
    "For a long time we worked on the app in our spare time, but recently we made an important decision: to commit to the project fully and leave our regular jobs.",
    "Right now MindHealth doesn’t yet cover our living expenses, but we have a financial safety cushion and a shared sense of confidence that we’ll get through this stage.",
    "We keep developing MindHealth every day and genuinely hope it becomes a helpful tool for supporting your mental health."
