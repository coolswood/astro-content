    "MindHealth team welcomes you! We are a small but cozy team, all fit on one photo.",
    "We are a married couple from Finland. Daniel, the programmer, wrote every line of code in this application. Sofia, our talented designer, made our product not only beautiful but also easy to use. And here in the center is the most important member of our team, our lizard Toothless, who gives us joy every day.",
    "Of course, there are other people working on the project, but they are not part of our team. For example, psychologists, authors of articles, etc. All these people are hired for individual tasks.",
    "We went through a severe period of depression in our lives and decided to found the MindHealth Project to make life easier for others.",
    "We created this page to be a little closer to our audience. If you are interested, we can share news happening in our lives and in the project.",
    "Developing the app in our spare time, we recently decided to fully dedicate ourselves to working on it, leaving our main job.",
    "Although the project is not yet generating enough income to sustain us, we have seed capital and we are confident that we can meet the challenge.",
    "We will continue to develop MindHealth in hopes that it will prove beneficial to your psychological health!"
