    "Our team has developed a unique algorithm for analyzing journal entries, which greatly helps users in examining their thoughts. Our model has been trained using open data and educational materials on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).",
    "Here are some recommendations to improve the quality of your entry analysis:",
    "Describe not only events but also delve into your emotions and thoughts in detail. Remember that the quality of the analysis directly depends on the quality of your entry.",
