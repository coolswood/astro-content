    "event": "Start by identifying the trigger that brought up difficult emotions or thoughts. A trigger can be anything — from a major event to something very small, or even just a fleeting thought.",
    "thought": "An automatic thought appears in response to an event and sets off a wave of emotions. These emotions can intensify and generate new negative thoughts, creating a vicious cycle. To keep it from growing, try to notice the automatic thought as early as possible and write it down.",
    "body": "Recall the moment the trigger appeared and pay attention to your body. What exactly did you feel physically? Which unpleasant sensations did you notice?",
    "behavior": "How did you behave after these emotions appeared? What did you do — or, on the contrary, what did you avoid doing?",
    "response": "When you notice an automatic thought, it’s important to look at it carefully. Such thoughts often contain cognitive distortions and logical errors. Your task is to find a rational, more realistic response and turn it into a supportive belief.",
    "conclusion": "Describe the conclusions you came to: did your emotional state change, how do you now see this situation, and what would you like to try next time in similar circumstances?",
    "comparison": "Write down the arguments that support the automatic thought and those that contradict it. This will help you evaluate it more objectively and see the situation from a broader perspective."

    "thought": "I feel like I make mistakes often, and because of that people around me treat me badly",
    "body": "I felt my heart start racing and a heaviness in my chest",
    "behavior": "I abruptly shut the door and walked out",
    "response": "Everyone makes mistakes — they’re a natural part of work and learning. One error doesn’t define me as a professional or as a person. I can’t know for sure what others actually think, and my assumptions about their attitude may be much harsher than reality.",
    "conclusion": "If a similar situation happens again, I’ll try not to jump to conclusions about other people’s reactions. If I’m unsure, I can clarify the situation directly instead of guessing. I’ll also create a short checklist to review tasks before submitting them, so I can feel more confident and reduce the likelihood of similar mistakes."
