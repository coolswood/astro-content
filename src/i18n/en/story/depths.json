  "description": "This article explores core beliefs—fundamental assumptions about yourself, other people, and the world that underlie your reactions and shape your intermediate beliefs and automatic thoughts. We focus on three categories of core beliefs—helplessness, unacceptability, and worthlessness—and explain why it’s important to work through all levels of thinking, starting with automatic thoughts, to create lasting change and move toward emotional well-being.",

      "We’ve now reached the deepest level—the level of core beliefs.",
      "Core beliefs are relatively stable, often unconscious ideas about yourself, other people, and the world.",
      "They typically form in childhood and can strongly influence your behavior and experience, even though you rarely notice them directly.",
      "You can think of them as invisible rails that guide the train of your life. Helpful beliefs support you; unhelpful ones often lead to inner conflict and emotional pain.",
      "Although we’ve separated beliefs into three levels for clarity, in real life they overlap and show up together.",
      "Sometimes a core belief can be heard inside an automatic thought—just in a softer, more disguised form.",
      "To see how this works in practice, consider Alexander:",
      "This lens shapes his actions: he becomes jealous, suspicious of his partner, tries to control her, feels insecure, and avoids taking initiative.",
      "In the end, he pushes his partner away himself, as if confirming his belief that he’s unworthy of love and that people can’t be trusted."

      "Three categories of core beliefs",
      "CBT founder Aaron Beck described two main categories of core beliefs; his daughter, Judith Beck, later added a third.",
      "These categories can overlap. For example, a sense of worthlessness can intensify helplessness: “I can’t do anything because I’m worthless.”",
      "And beliefs about not being accepted can lead to helplessness: “I can’t change how people treat me.”",
      "Let’s look at the three categories and examples of how they can show up.",
      "Core beliefs in the helplessness category",
      "These reflect a sense of weakness, difficulty coping, and not being able to influence what happens in your life. The person feels dependent and vulnerable.",
      "About self: “I’m weak,” “I’m incapable,” “I’m a failure,” “I can’t cope,” “I need protection.”",
      "About others: “Others are stronger than me,” “People are dangerous,” “They’ll criticize me,” “They have power over me.”",
      "About the world: “The world is complicated and hostile,” “It’s dangerous,” “Success is impossible,” “Life is unfair and harsh.”",
      "Core beliefs in the unacceptability category",
      "This group centers on feeling unlovable, unattractive, or like you don’t fit in. The person fears rejection and expects judgment.",
      "About self: “I’m unlikeable,” “I’m unattractive,” “I’m unlovable,” “I don’t belong,” “I don’t deserve acceptance.”",
      "About others: “People are demanding,” “People are cruel,” “They’ll reject me,” “They’ll judge me.”",
      "About the world: “The world pushes me away,” “The world devalues me,” “Expectations are too high,” “The world doesn’t care about me.”"

      "Core beliefs in the worthlessness category",
      "This category involves feeling inferior and insignificant. The person sees themselves as worse than others and undeserving of attention and respect.",
      "About self: “I’m worthless,” “I’m a failure,” “I’m stupid,” “I’m useless.”",
      "About others: “Others are better than me,” “People despise me,” “They look down on me,” “Others always succeed.”",
      "About the world: “The world is harsh and unfair,” “The world is cold and merciless,” “The world doesn’t value me,” “The world punishes me.”",
      "Where should you start when working with beliefs?",
      "It can be tempting to go straight to the deepest level. It seems logical: change the root and everything else will follow. But that’s not the most effective path.",
      "It’s usually better to begin with automatic thoughts—the most accessible, noticeable expressions of your beliefs.",
      "As you learn to spot automatic thoughts and generate more realistic alternatives, you lay a solid foundation for working with intermediate and core beliefs."
