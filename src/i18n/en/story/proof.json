      "CBT’s path to recognition was anything but simple or fast.",
      "In the early days, Beck’s theory was criticized by Freudians and many other colleagues — it was called “superficial”, and people doubted its effectiveness because there wasn’t enough scientific data yet. Even pharmaceutical companies spoke out against it, seeing effective psychotherapy as competition for psychotropic drugs.",
      "It took time, research, and solid data for CBT to build its evidence base.",
      "A turning point came in 1977: Beck’s studies showed that CBT helped people with depression more effectively than imipramine, one of the most powerful antidepressants of that time.",
      "Many years have passed since then, and today there are more than 200 major studies confirming the effectiveness of CBT in a wide range of situations."

      "Anxiety disorders: data from Norton and colleagues (2018) showed effectiveness in 46–66% of cases of generalized anxiety, with effects that were maintained over time.",
      "PTSD: a study by Schneider and colleagues (2014) showed significant improvement in 60–72% of people with post-traumatic stress disorder, and the benefits persisted in the long term.",
