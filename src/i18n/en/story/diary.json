  "description": "This article explains the practice of keeping an Automatic Thoughts Diary—one of the key tools in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We show how to record and analyze automatic thoughts to reduce psychological distress and lay the groundwork for deeper work on beliefs.",
  "screen_1": {
    "texts": [
      "One of CBT’s core tasks is working with your thoughts.",
      "Automatic thoughts are brief, quick versions of your beliefs; they reflect the content of deeper layers of thinking.",
      "Before you can work with a thought, you need to notice it and write it down.",
      "In this chapter, you’ll get to know a powerful self-reflection tool—the Automatic Thoughts Diary (also called an ABC diary).",
      "It’s not just a notebook for sad entries—it’s your personal “detective,” helping you uncover the causes of your mood and learn to influence it.",
      "The diary shows the link between what happens (situation), what we think (thoughts), and how we respond (emotions, sensations, behavior).",
      "That’s why it consists of several key sections:",
      "Situation: a brief description of what triggered the emotional reaction.",
      "Thought: the automatic thought that arose in response to the situation.",
      "Emotions: the feelings you experienced at that moment.",
      "Reaction: what you did or how you acted in response to those emotions.",
      "Alternative response: a more constructive thought or perspective that helps shift the emotional reaction.",
      "Let’s unpack each section.",
      "Situation",
      "Here we briefly describe what exactly triggered the difficult emotions.",
      "It’s important not only to outline the situation but to be as specific as possible.",
      "For example, “My mom hurt me” is too general—better to specify what she said or did.",
      "And instead of “I worked badly,” specify: “I made a mistake in my report.”",
      "A trigger can be not only an external event but also internal sensations, thoughts, or memories—the key is to phrase it clearly."

      "Automatic thought",
      "This section is about how you interpret the situation.",
      "To catch your thoughts, ask yourself: “What am I thinking right now?”",
      "Identify the most salient, emotionally charged thought.",
      "If the wording is too broad, tighten it and make it specific.",
      "Rate how strongly you believe this thought on a 0–10 scale.",
      "For example, if the “Situation” says “I made a mistake in my report,” possible thoughts include: “I’ll never do anything well,” “I’m a failure,” “Mistakes are stupid.”",
      "Choose the thought that resonates most, write it down, and note your conviction level.",
      "Emotions",
      "For this section, ask yourself two questions:",
      "What emotions did I feel? (sadness, anger, anxiety, guilt, fear, shame, etc.)",
      "How intense were these emotions? (from 0 to 10)",
      "Example: sadness — 9, despair — 7, dejection — 5.",
      "Body sensations",
      "Here we record physical reactions during strong emotions—how your body responded.",
      "Be specific: a lump in the throat, cold sweat, heaviness in the stomach, etc.",
      "Behavior",
      "Describe what you did after the thoughts and emotions appeared.",
      "What actions followed?",
      "Behavior may include, for example, crying or snapping at colleagues.",
      "Adaptive response",
      "In this column, analyze the original thought and formulate a more adaptive, supportive reply.",
      "Helpful questions:",
      "How realistic is this thought?",
      "What facts support it, and what facts contradict it?",
      "What are the worst, best, and most likely outcomes?",
      "What happens if I keep believing this thought? And what changes if I reconsider it?",
      "For example, instead of “I will never do anything well,” try: “I’ll correct the mistake and learn from it. Everyone makes mistakes.”",
      "In our app, the diary also helps track cognitive distortions.",
      "Let’s briefly clarify what that means.",
      "Cognition refers to mental processes of perception and thinking (thoughts, images, representations). Cognitive distortions are errors in how the brain processes information.",
      "They interfere with logical, rational thinking and make reality look skewed.",
      "If you spot a distortion in your thoughts, mark it.",
      "If not—no problem, simply skip this section for now."

      "Why keep an Automatic Thoughts Diary?",
      "Keeping a diary is key to deep self-understanding: it helps you see the links between emotions, thoughts, and behavior.",
      "Regular entries reveal recurring patterns that shape your mood and actions.",
      "The act of writing builds mindfulness.",
      "You start noticing which thoughts arise in different situations, making it easier to guide your responses.",
      "In therapy (and beyond), your entries provide valuable material for self-analysis.",
      "They’re useful both in sessions with a therapist and for independent practice.",
      "Why write things down?",
      "What isn’t written down easily gets lost in the folds of memory.",
      "We often think we’ll keep it all in our head—and then we don’t.",
      "Reflection—analyzing our experiences—grows when we formulate our thoughts and put them down somewhere outside our head.",
      "That way we preserve important insights and understand ourselves more deeply.",
      "Tips for making the diary work:",
      "Consistency is key: the diary isn’t a magic wand—it needs your practice. Fill it out regularly to see results.",
      "Catch the moment: jot thoughts and feelings down as soon as they appear. It’s easier to “catch” automatic thoughts before they fade.",
      "Progress over perfection: don’t chase flawless entries. Any small win is already a step forward.",
      "Diary-keeping is a skill that takes time.",
      "Be patient with yourself and give yourself time to settle into the habit."
