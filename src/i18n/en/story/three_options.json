  "title": "The “Three Possible Outcomes” Technique",
  "description": "This text describes a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) technique for working with negative automatic thoughts — the “Three Possible Outcomes” method. It helps broaden your view of a situation and reduce anxiety by deliberately considering the worst, best, and most realistic scenarios. Regular practice gradually reduces the intensity of negative emotions.",

      "CBT offers many simple and useful tools for working with negative automatic thoughts.",
      "Some techniques help you notice these thoughts, others test them against common sense so you gradually trust them less. Most exercises can be done on your own to support your emotional state. In this chapter we’ll share a tool that works especially well when you get stuck on a single thought. It’s called the “Three Possible Outcomes” technique.",
      "If you’ve already learned to catch the thoughts that really hurt, you’ve probably noticed: many of them are irrational and poorly aligned with the facts — yet we still tend to believe them and don’t always know what to do with them.",
      "The main goal of this technique is to widen your field of view and show your mind that, besides the anxious scenario, there are other options. As you practice, you’ll learn to question negative thoughts and lower your anxiety in stressful situations.",
      "What do you do? The structure is simple. As soon as you notice a thought that spoils your mood, ask yourself: how could events unfold?",
      "Worst case — the most unpleasant option, which usually comes to mind first;",
      "Best case — the ideal outcome that would fully satisfy you;",
      "Realistic — something in between the first and the second: a balanced scenario grounded in experience and facts.",
      "An important detail: it’s better not to keep these options in your head, but to write them down. You can do this on your phone or on paper — whatever is more convenient. Putting things in writing helps you look at the situation more soberly."

      "That’s enough theory — let’s move on to an example.",
      "Imagine you have an important exam tomorrow — at university or at work — and the thought comes: “I’m going to fail the exam.”",
      "There are no guarantees about the outcome yet, but the thought is already making you anxious. So let’s give your brain some alternatives.",
      "Worst case: I’ll prepare badly, get confused during the exam and fail it. Even worse — I’ll be the only one in the group who doesn’t pass. The lecturer will be disappointed, and my classmates will decide I’m lazy and disorganized.",
      "Best case: I’ll calmly arrive at the exam, get an easy question and pass with the highest grade. Or even better — the whole group will get top marks without having to sit the exam at all.",
      "Most realistic: I don’t know which question I’ll get, but today I can review the more difficult topics so I feel calmer tomorrow. A bit of nervousness is normal. Overall I know the material and will be able to answer most of the questions. The lecturer is generally well-disposed towards me and has no reason to “fail” me on purpose. In the morning I’ll go over the trickier parts again and feel more confident. Most likely I’ll pass at least with a satisfactory grade, and if I stay focused — with a good or even an excellent one."

      "This approach gives you at least three possible outcomes — and in reality there are usually even more.",
      "It’s helpful to think through a “backup plan” in advance for the worst-case scenario.",
      "This significantly lowers the emotional intensity: even if the worst does happen, you’ll already have an idea of how to respond.",
      "For example: if I really do fail the exam tomorrow, I’ll have a chance to retake it. It’s unpleasant, but I can set aside another day or two to prepare and put things right.",
      "It’s unlikely that the lecturer’s and my classmates’ attitude toward me will radically change because of one failure; and if it does, that will simply show how much their opinion is really worth.",
      "Looking at things this way, the situation no longer seems so frightening, and the thought no longer feels like the only option.",
      "At first it may seem either too simple or, on the contrary, too time-consuming to write all this out.",
      "But practice shows: this technique really works as a self-help tool — and that’s exactly why we’re offering it to you."
