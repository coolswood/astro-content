  "description": "This article explores the psychological phenomenon of personalization—the belief that you are the cause of everything that happens around you. It explains how this thinking style works and how it leads to stress, anxiety, low self-esteem, and difficulties in relationships. The article also looks at where this belief comes from, starting with childhood experiences and cultural influences, and offers recommendations for overcoming personalization and freeing yourself from unnecessary guilt.",

      "Yet you keep tormenting yourself, judging yourself, and carrying a heavy sense of guilt.",
      "Paradoxically, this belief in your own omnipotence and limitless power actually constrains you, fueling anxiety and making you less effective.",

      "“It’s all because of me”: you tend to believe that everything that happens in life is the result of your own actions. It does not matter whether it is good or bad — you take full responsibility.",

      "It is well known that children’s thinking is egocentric — a child sincerely believes they are the cause of everything that happens around them.",
      "For a three- or four-year-old, it is completely normal to think that the sun rises because they woke up and sets because it is time for them to go to bed.",
      "However, many adults continue to use elements of this egocentric thinking in everyday life.",
      "Family or social pressure can push someone to feel responsible for other people’s well-being. For example, a child who has to take care of their parents from an early age.",
      "Low self-esteem can be both a consequence and a cause of these beliefs.",
      "People with low self-esteem are often prone to personalization. They may believe they do not deserve to be treated well and therefore attribute negative events to their own actions or flaws.",
      "Traumatic experiences in the past can also contribute to personalization. In early childhood, thinking is especially vulnerable to distortions, and a child can easily come to believe that everything depends on them.",
      "For example, if someone often heard from their parents, “It’s all your fault,” or “You never do anything right,” they may carry this label for life, blaming themselves for every negative event.",
      "In some cultures, people are encouraged to take responsibility for everything that happens around them. This can make them more prone to personalization, even when they are not actually at fault.",
      "Whatever the reasons behind these beliefs, we can change our thinking at any point in life if we are motivated to do so.",
      "In the next chapter, as usual, we will look at key recommendations for working with the belief in your own omnipotence."

        "To overcome this harmful style of thinking, it’s important to identify the true causes of the problems that have arisen.",
        "Instead of blaming yourself for things that are beyond your control and, consequently, feeling guilty towards the entire world, focus on analyzing the situation.",
        "Start with self-observation. The first step to reducing personalization is awareness, as with any other irrational thinking. Pay close attention to your thoughts and reactions to events. Notice when you tend to take responsibility for something that is actually beyond your control.",

        "Consider possible reasons for other people’s behavior that are unrelated to your actions. Try to put yourself in their shoes and understand what might have influenced their reaction. For example, what else could have caused their mood or behavior?"
