  "description": "This article explores the psychological phenomenon of personalization—the belief that you are the cause of everything happening around you. The text reveals the mechanisms of this thinking, its negative consequences such as stress, anxiety, low self-esteem, and relationship issues. It also examines the reasons for the formation of such beliefs, starting from childhood and the influence of cultural norms. In conclusion, recommendations are provided on how to overcome personalization and free yourself from unjustified guilt.",

      "You are convinced that people around you are reacting solely to you, that their actions, thoughts, and feelings entirely depend on your behavior, even though this is beyond your control.",
      "But you torment yourself, condemning yourself and feeling a crushing sense of guilt.",
      "Paradoxically, the belief in your own omnipotence and omniscience limits you, plunging you into anxiety and reducing your efficiency.",
      "How does personalization manifest?",
      "“It’s all because of me”: You tend to believe that everything that happens in life is the result of your own actions. It doesn’t matter if it’s good or bad, you take full responsibility.",
      "“It’s all about me”: You are convinced that those around you are constantly thinking about you, talking about you, noticing all your mistakes and shortcomings.",

      "Where does personalization come from?",
      "This type of belief forms in childhood.",
      "It is known that children’s thinking is egocentric, meaning a child sincerely believes that they are the cause of everything happening around them.",
      "For example, it is completely normal for three- to four-year-old children to believe that the sun rises because they woke up and sets when it’s time for them to go to bed.",
      "However, many adults, even as they grow up, still use elements of egocentric thinking in their daily lives.",
      "Family or societal pressure can make a person feel responsible for the well-being of others. For example, a child who is forced to care for their parents at an early age.",
      "Self-esteem issues can be both a consequence and a cause of such beliefs.",
      "People with low self-esteem are often prone to personalization. They may believe that they don’t deserve to be treated well, and thus attribute negative events to their own actions or shortcomings.",
      "Traumatic experiences in the past can also contribute to personalization. At an early age, there is a high likelihood of a child’s thinking becoming distorted, leading them to believe that everything that happens depends on them.",
      "For example, if someone often heard phrases like “It’s all your fault” or “You never do anything right” from their parents during childhood, they might carry this “label” throughout life, attributing all negative events to their own fault.",
      "In some cultures, it is customary to take responsibility for everything that happens around you. This can lead people to be prone to personalization, even if they are not to blame for what happens.",
      "Whatever the reasons for the formation of beliefs, we can change our thinking at any stage of life if we have the motivation.",
      "In the next chapter, we will, as usual, discuss the main recommendations for dealing with the belief in your own omnipotence."

        "Internally, this is not experienced as a sense of immense power or strength, but as constant pressure, attention from others, and hidden hostility.",
        "To overcome this harmful style of thinking, it’s important to identify the true causes of the problems that have arisen.",
        "Instead of blaming yourself for things that are beyond your control and, consequently, feeling guilty towards the entire world, focus on analyzing the situation.",
        "Start with self-observation. The first step to reducing personalization is awareness, as with any other irrational thinking. Pay close attention to your thoughts and reactions to events. Notice when you tend to take responsibility for something that is actually beyond your control.",
        "Then, try to identify other factors that could have influenced the situation for which you took responsibility. For example: “Is it really true that I am solely to blame for this argument? What other factors and circumstances could have played a role?”",
        "Consider possible reasons for other people’s behavior that are unrelated to your actions. Try to put yourself in their shoes and understand what might have influenced their reaction. For example, what else could have caused their mood or behavior?"
