  "description": "This article explores perfectionism, emphasizing that striving for high standards can be helpful, but when it turns into rigid demands, it leads to negative consequences such as anxiety and chronic dissatisfaction. Real-life examples show how early experiences and upbringing can contribute to the development of perfectionistic beliefs and behaviors. The article concludes with an invitation to find a balance between aiming for excellence and accepting a \"good enough\" result in order to avoid burnout and disappointment.",

      "When these stay at the level of wishes, aspirations, and goals, we can talk about constructive beliefs that support us and motivate us.",
      "But when these wishes turn into rigid, inflexible demands, and the price of meeting them becomes too high, this is no longer just about high standards — it is perfectionism.",

      "Perfectionism — the belief that everything has to be done 100% perfectly — often lies at the root of many difficulties.",
      "You strive for an ideal: mistakes feel unacceptable, and any failure seems like a catastrophe. You may feel that you must look, feel, think, and behave flawlessly in every situation.",
      "As soon as you reach one goal, it is instantly replaced by another, even more distant one, so you never really feel satisfaction or recognition for your efforts. Life turns into a gray, exhausting routine, because you live trying to match unrealistic and sometimes impossible standards.",

      "A model of perfectionism in practice",
      "According to cognitive behavioral therapy, our life experience shapes our core beliefs about ourselves, other people, and the world. These beliefs, in turn, drive the rules and strategies we follow in everyday life.",
      "Let’s take Eugene as an example. His parents always set very high expectations for him: any grade below “excellent” was treated as a failure.",
      "Even though he was clearly gifted in music, his parents criticized his achievements and pushed him toward a more “prestigious” career in medicine.",
      "This experience led Eugene to develop a deep belief that he is “not good enough” and “not competent”.",
      "To compensate for this and to feel like a good, capable person, he adopted a rule: “I must do everything perfectly.”",
      "His drive for perfection pushes him to overwork, scold himself for the smallest mistakes, and be highly critical of his colleagues. This leads to exhaustion, anxiety, relationship problems, and dissatisfaction with life.",
      "He often sets unrealistic goals for himself — for instance, preparing a flawless presentation in very limited time.",
      "If he manages to do this (which is unlikely), his rule is reinforced and gives him an illusion of control. If he does not succeed, he blames himself, which further confirms his belief in his own incompetence.",
      "It becomes a vicious circle: the rule “do everything perfectly” protects Eugene from painful feelings of “not being enough”, but only as long as he can keep up with his excessively high, unrealistic standards.",
      "Any mistake triggers intense negative emotions, fuels his self-criticism, and strengthens perfectionism.",
      "What might perfectionistic beliefs sound like?",
      "I have to do everything perfectly.",
      "Everything I do has to work out.",
      "If I don’t give 100%, I might as well not do it at all.",
      "If someone criticizes me, it means I did a bad job. Doing a bad job is unacceptable.",
      "I am not allowed to make mistakes.",
      "I must be the best at everything I do.",
      "How does this constant drive for an ideal develop?",
      "Most often, this tendency starts in early childhood or primary school as a result of family upbringing."

      "Researchers believe that neurotic perfectionism develops under the influence of childhood experiences with parents who either showed love only under certain conditions (for grades, results, achievements, etc.) or did not show approval at all.",
      "In both cases, the child develops a strong wish to be perfect in order to prove to their parents — and to themselves — that they can be good and worthy. Parents of perfectionistic children often criticize a lot, withhold support, and have very high demands.",
      "To meet their expectations and avoid punishment or criticism, the child feels forced to try to be flawless.",
      "In general, there are four types of parental behavior that can contribute to the development of perfectionism:",
      "Parents themselves model highly perfectionistic behavior.",
      "Parents are overly critical and demanding toward the child, and emotional support and help are lacking.",
      "Parental approval is absent, inconsistent, or strictly conditional.",
      "Parenting is authoritarian, with excessive expectations and rigid control.",
      "Starting school encourages children to translate their success into grades.",
      "This is where the “straight-A student” pattern often develops, which psychologists link to perfectionism. The child tries to be the best at everything, and if this does not work out, polarized “all-or-nothing” thinking is activated.",
      "If it is impossible to be the best in a particular subject, the child may choose the opposite strategy — to become the worst — as if thinking, “If I can’t be first, I might as well be last.”"

      "The media sets trends and standards of beauty and success. Looking good, dressing stylishly, and taking care of your appearance are portrayed as conditions for finding a partner, getting a prestigious job, and having an attractive social circle.",
      "Because of this, people can become convinced that they must live up to very high standards in order to belong.",
      "So is perfectionism good or bad?",
      "This question often sparks debate: some see perfectionism as helpful, others as harmful.",
      "If you are a perfectionist, you will probably say that striving for perfection is normal — how else could you achieve success? But in reality, perfectionism drains a huge amount of your energy and resources, slowly but relentlessly exhausting both body and mind.",
      "Perfectionism is closely linked to achievement dependence, which we discussed in previous chapters, and its drawbacks are very similar.",
      "Excessive, unrealistic standards affect almost every area of life: work, studies, relationships, and even rest.",
      "The core problem is that the ideal you are chasing simply does not exist. An ideal is a hypothetical, “perfect” state of an object or phenomenon — and everyone imagines it differently.",
      "Let’s be honest and ask: is there anything that is absolutely perfect for everyone?",
      "What you see as ideal may seem completely meaningless to someone else. Even Mozart’s music and da Vinci’s paintings are not universally loved, despite being considered masterpieces.",
      "When you adjust your beliefs to be more in line with reality, you will be able to feel satisfaction with what you have done and with your life in general, rather than constant disappointment.",
      "It is crucial to learn how to balance striving for the best with being satisfied with a good, workable result."
