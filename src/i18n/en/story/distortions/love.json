  "title": "Dependence on Love",
  "description": "Love, celebrated by poets and artists, uplifts and gives a sense of life's fullness. However, turning love into a pathological need destroys personality and hinders building healthy relationships, especially in people with low self-esteem. True happiness and life fulfillment can be found by learning to regulate one's mood and enjoying pleasures that do not depend on the presence of a partner.",

      "Love is a magnificent feeling, celebrated by poets, artists, and musicians. It uplifts, inspires, and provides a sense of life's fullness.",
      "Naturally, each of us strives to love and be loved.",
      "However, if your view of love boils down to the belief: “I cannot be truly happy and fulfilled if I do not have a partner. To be completely happy, I need to be loved,” it is already a sign of dependency.",
      "What does it mean to be dependent on love?",
      "It means that love becomes a pathological necessity without which you cannot feel happiness.",
      "You suffer from the lack of love, expecting someone to fill this void. You are convinced that your life will only become better, more interesting, and fuller when a loved one appears who makes you feel needed, significant, and complete.",
      "Such dependency is a destructive state that undermines your personality, self-esteem, and ability to build healthy relationships.",
      "The causes of love dependency can vary, but most often they have roots in childhood or adolescence.",
      "Particularly susceptible to this are people with low self-esteem, who fear loneliness, focus on their flaws, and do not believe in their own strengths and abilities.",
      "Low self-esteem, stemming from childhood, is perceived as inadequacy.",
      "When parents give little attention to a child and he lacks parental love, he will seek these feelings in partners as an adult, forming dependent relationships.",
      "Consider the example of Victoria, 28, who spends her evenings and weekends in despair because she believes: “I can only be happy in a relationship. Without a man, I am nothing.”",
      "For her, being loved is as important as breathing. Such demanding nature often repels people."

      "The disadvantages sounded like this:",
      "The belief plunges me into despair because I am alone.",
      "I lose the desire to do anything, explore the world, or engage in hobbies.",
      "Because of this, I feel lazy and unhappy.",
      "It causes me to feel pity for myself",
      "It deprives me of pride and confidence, making me envy others and feel disappointed.",
      "Then she listed the advantages of the belief:",
      "The hope to find a partner, gain love and security.",
      "It gives me a purpose and meaning in life.",
      "How realistic are these advantages?",
      "Victoria has believed for many years that she cannot live without a man, but this belief has so far not attracted the desired partner to her.",
      "Victoria concluded that she places too much importance on men, and this has not attracted any of them.",
      "She also realized that dependent people often appear too demanding, which complicates building relationships.",
      "She saw that people who find happiness within themselves often attract others because they radiate joy and confidence.",
      "Love dependency hinders building healthy relationships. By expressing a need for another person for your own happiness, you subconsciously communicate: “Love me, because without you, I am worth nothing.” Such relationships are unlikely to be healthy.",
      "Even if you are in a relationship based on such beliefs, they are unlikely to be healthy. Because you entirely rely on a certain person, whom you subconsciously consider the source of your happiness, to be by your side.",
      "And you are ready to do anything for this. Not receiving the 'dose' of emotions and feelings you need, you will exert pressure on your partner to feel loved, or you will start fantasizing about finding that true love elsewhere.",
      "And you will always lack something or 'something is not right,' because you have placed the responsibility for your condition on another person."

      "Many believe that love is what makes the world go round. You see it in advertisements, hear it in popular songs, read it in poems. But in reality, love is not the only path to a happy and fulfilled life.",
      "Being alone does not equate to being unhappy. Most of life's pleasures we derive on our own.",
      "For example, when you listen to your favorite music, dance, walk through beautiful places, read a book, or eat ice cream. You do not need company to experience pleasant sensations.",
      "The number of pleasures one can enjoy alone is endless. This means that you have access to many sources of pleasure regardless of whether someone is nearby or not.",

        "Happiness can be found every day in small joys, personal development, friendships, and many other aspects of life.",
        "But most likely, you don't think so and are convinced that you cannot be happy without another person.",
        "To test this belief for reality, use the “List of Expected Pleasure.” It has several columns where you need to predict and indicate the actual degree of pleasure you get from various activities (work and leisure) alone or in the company of other people.",
        "In the first column, indicate the date of the experiment.",
        "In the second, write down several activities you plan to do that day as part of the experiment (we recommend conducting 40–50 experiments over two to three weeks. Choose activities that usually bring you a sense of satisfaction or enjoyment, or those that have the potential for learning or personal growth).",
        "In the third column, write down with whom you will do these activities. If alone, write: “I”.",
        "In the fourth column, estimate how much pleasure each activity will bring you, rating it on a scale from 0 to 100% — the higher the number, the greater the expected pleasure.",
        "It is very important to fill in the fourth column before you start the planned activity, not after! Once you have filled in the first four columns, proceed with the activity.",
        "Afterward, in the fifth column, record the actual degree of pleasure, using the same rating system — from 0 to 100%.",
        "After conducting a series of such experiments, you can analyze the data you have collected and learn a lot about yourself.",
        "Firstly, by comparing the expected pleasure (column 4) with the actual pleasure (column 5), you will see how accurate your predictions are.",
        "You may realize that you usually underestimate the degree of pleasure you expect to receive, especially when doing something alone.",
        "You might also be surprised to learn that activities with someone else do not always meet your expectations.",
        "In fact, you might even find that in many cases, spending time alone was more enjoyable than being in company.",
        "And you may also see that the highest ratings you gave to solitary activities are equal to or even higher than the ratings for activities in company."

        "If love were a cure for loneliness, problems, bad moods, and depression, then all psychologists would be out of work.",

        "Read these notes every day for 2-3 weeks; you can supplement or change them. In this way, you will be able to overcome negative thinking patterns and lay the foundation for your changes.",
        "Love is a wonderful experience, but like any other, it can be both positive and negative and should not define who we are and why we are here.",
        "Desire and need are not the same. Oxygen is a need, and love is a desire.",
        "Love is not a need for an adult!",
        "The desire to build a love relationship is normal. There is nothing wrong with it. Good relationships with a loved one are a wonderful pleasure.",
