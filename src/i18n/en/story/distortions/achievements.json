  "description": "Love can inspire, give strength, and fill life with meaning. But when it turns into a need you can’t feel whole without, it starts to erode you and gets in the way of healthy relationships. The same thing happens with achievement addiction. Lasting happiness becomes possible when you learn to lean not only on success, but also on your feelings, values, and your ability to find joy beyond results.",

      "We live in an age of constant achievement chasing, where success often becomes the main measure of our worth. It can seem as if anyone can achieve anything, as long as they try hard enough.",
      "Ambition appears to have no limits, and life turns into an endless race where we start to believe that a person’s value is defined by their results.",
      "At first glance, this belief may seem harmless—but in practice it can cause real harm.",
      "What is achievement addiction?",
      "It’s when your self-esteem depends entirely on your productivity, status, intelligence, or professional success.",
      "As long as things are going well at school or at work, you feel like a whole, worthy person. But as soon as something goes wrong, you’re hit by intense negative emotions.",
      "In those moments, it can feel as if you’re a failure and “worth nothing.”",
      "What beliefs grow out of this dependence?",
      "If I don’t succeed, it’s a catastrophe. It means I’m weak / stupid / worthless.",
      "If something didn’t work out, it means I’m a loser.",
      "If I’ve failed, no one needs me and I’ll never achieve anything.",
      "I absolutely must be successful; otherwise my life will lose its meaning and I’ll never be happy.",
      "An obsession with achievement shows up in people of all genders. These days, women are also increasingly focused on career and professional growth.",
      "At the same time, men are often especially vulnerable to failure, because from childhood they’ve heard that their value is measured by success.",
      "Why do these beliefs form?",
      "Most often, the roots lie in childhood. Maybe your parents were emotionally distant and didn’t offer unconditional love and support.",
      "A child tries to make sense of this.",
      "If the kid next door is loved and praised and I’m not, something must be wrong with me. If I were better, they’d love me too.",
      "Another pattern is when attention and warmth only show up in response to achievements.",
      "Get an A—“Good job!” Struggle or fall short—and it’s as if you’re invisible."

      "Another common scenario is an absent parent. Children explain everything through themselves.",
      "If Dad left, it must mean I wasn’t good enough, not that the adults couldn’t work things out. So if I become successful, smart, the best, he’ll come back—or at least realize what he lost.",
      "These childhood conclusions become the foundation of achievement addiction. Later experiences in adolescence and adulthood can only reinforce this belief.",
      "The person learns: you can only be loved for what you achieve. To avoid rejection, you have to constantly prove your worth.",
      "And when the image of the “ideal self” doesn’t match reality, it leads to pain, shame, and a sense of worthlessness.",
      "The first step toward change is realizing that measuring your worth solely by your achievements is harmful. Choosing to stop evaluating yourself only through success is a crucial point of growth.",
      "Of course, achievement addiction can also give you a sense of power.",
      "It brings a feeling of superiority: you made it—others didn’t.",
      "This mindset can be motivating, helping you grow, build a career, and earn money.",
      "Each new achievement seems to add to your value. You want to be better again and again. On the surface, that doesn’t sound so bad.",
      "But what are the downsides of the “worth = success” mindset?",
      "When your career or business is going well, you can become so absorbed in it that you cut yourself off from other sources of joy.",
      "Relationships with loved ones move to the background: work always seems more important.",
      "You end up living in a state of constant busyness, from morning till night.",
      "If you slow down, you feel emptiness, anxiety, and a sense that you’re wasting time. Rest starts to feel like weakness.",
      "Without achievements, you feel like you’re worth nothing, because you have no other foundation for your self-worth.",
      "This can lead to burnout, health problems, chronic stress, and depression.",
      "Workaholism becomes an addiction of its own, keeping the obsession with success going."

      "When you’ve lived only for achievements and can no longer produce them, you may feel a total sense of emptiness and loss of meaning.",
      "Sometimes this leads to desperate steps, because your self-esteem was completely tied to outcomes.",
      "As with any addiction, tolerance develops: you need more and more success, recognition, and achievements.",
      "Each new result brings less joy, and you have to push harder to feel satisfied.",

      "They’re not directly linked. In the end, you find yourself chasing an illusion.",

    "description": "The article discusses the dangers of being addicted to success, pointing out that achievements do not guarantee happiness and well-being. Examples of celebrities like Lady Gaga and Jim Carrey illustrate that even the most successful people can suffer from depression and other issues. The importance of finding a balance between goals and personal life, as well as recognizing the intrinsic value of each person regardless of their achievements, are the key takeaways.",

        "Of course, you shouldn't give up all your endeavors or abandon important goals to cope with addiction to success.",
        "After all, there is nothing wrong with having achievements. It’s wonderful to have money, a job, a car, an apartment, etc.",
        "Problems begin when you consider yourself worthless, a failure, and an unworthy person without these indicators of success.",
        "To free yourself from the trap of having to be outstanding and effective, we suggest you think about the following:",
        "Are you ready to ride the roller coaster of self-esteem all your life?",
        "If you think rationally, by choosing to live by the concept of achievements, you are dooming yourself to endless emotional swings.",
        "Today you have reached some heights and are happy, but tomorrow you fail, and life takes on completely different colors. There are achievements – you’re great, no achievements – you’re a failure.",
        "Your mood will be easily controlled. If others understand that you are dependent on achievements, they can easily use this to their advantage.",
        "For example, a boss can overload you, knowing that you will work yourself to death but do everything for the next praise.",
        "Achievements do not equal happiness.",
        "Money, fame, and achievements have long been seen as a guarantee of happiness and well-being. But if happiness depended on a person's success, we would observe significant differences between people of different social statuses.",
        "Most people cannot boast serious achievements, yet many of them are happy and satisfied with their lives.",
        "But again, being content does not mean not striving or wanting more. There is a huge gap between a healthy desire to achieve set goals and dependency.",
        "In reality, even those who earn a lot, hold prestigious positions, or own a successful business, can suffer from depression, have various problems, or simply become disillusioned with life.",
        "For example, the well-known Lady Gaga, who seems successful, rich, and happy at first glance, founded the ‘Born This Way Foundation’ to help teenagers in difficult situations because the singer knows about difficulties firsthand.",
        "“I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life, and I continue to fight it every day,” she admitted in a 2015 interview with Billboard.",
        "Or Jim Carrey, who gave fans the opportunity to sincerely smile and receive positive emotions from his work, but even at the peak of his popularity, the actor did not feel like laughing.",
        "Jim fought severe depression for many years.",
        "This is not only about celebrities; businesspeople often complain about mental disorders and dependencies.",
        "In fact, many successful people end their lives by suicide. There is even a special term – ‘CEO suicide.’",
        "This phenomenon has affected: billionaire Adolf Merckle from the Forbes list, startup founders Ilya Zhitomirskiy and Austin Heinz, fashion house owner Kate Spade, and many others.",

        "Comparing yourself with others brings nothing but discomfort and self-doubt.",
