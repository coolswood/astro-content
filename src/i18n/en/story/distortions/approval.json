  "description": "This article explores how dependence on other people’s approval makes us vulnerable to their opinions and gets in the way of stable self-esteem. We look at how underlying beliefs shape emotions and your sense of self-worth, and why self-validation matters more than external praise. At the end, you’ll find practical steps to help you rethink your need for approval and strengthen your inner foundation.",

      "Everyone likes to be appreciated. It’s natural for social beings to look for confirmation of their worth in other people’s reactions and opinions.",
      "The problem begins when the wish for approval turns into a dependency and starts to limit your life.",
      "You may have caught yourself thinking: “If he didn’t praise me, something is wrong with me,” or “If people don’t approve of me, that’s horrible.”",
      "These beliefs turn your emotions into a swing: praise sends you up, criticism drags your mood down.",
      "The beliefs behind these thoughts are logically fragile. For example, you might assume that someone’s praise or compliment automatically proves that you’re good, smart, or capable.",
      "In reality, it’s your own beliefs that shape how you feel.",
      "Compliments won’t lift your mood if you don’t believe they’re sincere. Your mood shifts when, deep down, you agree that you deserve the praise.",
      "Many people recognize this situation: the praise sounds polite, but not convincing—so you don’t really take it in.",
      "Did you actually feel pleasure from that kind of “praise”? Most likely not. Before your mood improves, you automatically check the external evaluation for authenticity—and that inner check is an act of self-approval."

      "For example, a positive review from your manager may feel like meaningful praise and give you a boost. But words of support from your mother, who is far from your field of work, may not have the same effect.",
      "This happens because you doubt how true those words are. The conclusion is: it’s your own beliefs about yourself that determine how you feel.",
      "Other people can say anything about you—good or bad—but your emotions depend on what you believe about yourself.",
      "The price of relying on praise is becoming overly sensitive to other people’s opinions.",
      "Like someone who is dependent and suddenly left without a “dose,” you feel the lack of approval sharply and keep trying to get more of it.",
      "If someone important to you disagrees with you, it hurts. You may be tempted to sacrifice your own needs out of fear of being rejected.",
      "There’s a revealing paradox: many notorious criminals, like Charles Manson, had admirers who saw them as a “messiah,” despite their crimes.",
      "If even such a person was not completely deprived of approval, what terrible thing have you done to be rejected by everyone? Does someone’s approval automatically make that person a worthy human being? Are you equating approval with value?",
      "It’s natural and pleasant to be approved of: it’s important to feel that you’re doing something right and that your efforts are appreciated.",
      "Likewise, rejection or criticism is unpleasant—that’s a normal reaction.",
      "The danger lies elsewhere: in believing that approval or disapproval accurately reflects your worth as a person."

    "question": "According to the article, how should you relate to other people’s disapproval?",
    "answers": [
      "Treat it as a direct reflection of your personal worth",

      "Do you ever criticize others yourself? Do you allow yourself to disagree with someone’s opinion? Most likely, yes. And even then, you don’t usually make a sweeping judgment about the whole person—you just see things differently.",
      "Most often, it’s specific actions or words that upset us, not “the whole person” as such—and that’s an important distinction.",
      "Your loved ones may have flaws, but that doesn’t make them “worthless.”",
      "If your disapproval doesn’t strip someone else of their worth, why do you allow other people’s opinions to completely devalue you?",
      "When you worry that someone doesn’t like you, you’re overestimating their wisdom and, as if, giving up your own right to an opinion.",
      "Yes, someone may point out your weak spots—and that can be useful; that’s how we learn. No one is perfect, and people are allowed to give feedback.",
      "There are many possible roots of approval-seeking: bullying at school, pressure from family expectations, the belief that “praise is good, and if there is no praise, I’ve done something wrong,” painful relationship experiences.",
      "The origins often lie in family patterns: children trust adults and easily absorb the habit of putting themselves down.",
      "You’ve grown up, but external approval may still be “standing in” for an inner sense of worth.",
      "It’s not your fault that you absorbed these scripts as a child; blaming yourself for that makes no sense.",
      "But now, as an adult, it is your responsibility to test how realistic these beliefs are and take steps to change them.",
      "Next, we’ll look at specific practices to help you apply these ideas and build stable self-esteem and self-respect."
