      "Cognitive-behavioral therapy points out that destructive beliefs stand between us and a happy life. These beliefs, often based on misconceptions, hinder the achievement of desired outcomes.",
      "Each of us encounters such beliefs at various times in our lives, which can lead to various psychological issues, including depression, panic attacks, anxiety, and eating disorders.",
      "Sometimes we feel quite well, as if problems do not affect us. However, at other times, we may be engulfed by such sadness and loneliness that it seems there is no light at the end of the tunnel.",
      "In fact, there is a significant difference between temporary well-being and true improvement in quality of life, which lies in changing our thinking.",
      "Temporary well-being occurs when problems recede for a while, but return with new strength when a difficult situation arises.",
      "At this stage, you can 'work through' the problem, it seems to fade into the background, but then a traumatic event occurs and everything starts all over again."

      "We want to help you understand the deep causes of your beliefs and provide a foundation for working with them, as well as for the prevention of depression and anxiety disorders.",
      "Identifying such settings will help clarify the main reason why you are trapped in your problems or your condition, and also help understand at what times in your life you may be vulnerable.",
      "Working with beliefs is the key to personal growth.",
      "The critical importance of identifying destructive beliefs led to the development of a relatively simple method for their detection. It is called the 'Dysfunctional Belief Scale' and was developed by Dr. Arlin Weisman.",
      "Weisman's research proved that, despite a sharp decrease in the intensity of negative automatic thoughts between depressive episodes, the destructive belief system persists both during episodes and throughout life.",
      "This confirmed the concept that beliefs represent a predisposition to emotional instability, which constantly accompanies you.",
      "Thanks to this method, you will be able to identify the values that form your destructive beliefs and create a vulnerability that predisposes you to depression, neuroses, and a range of other problems.",
      "This is your psychological Achilles' heel.",
      "In subsequent chapters, we will look more closely at these values, helping you to identify and evaluate your own settings and learn to develop realistic and constructive cognitive settings for long-term emotional well-being."
