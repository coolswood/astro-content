      "Imagine a triangle whose corners are thoughts, feelings, and behavior.",
      "These three elements don’t just coexist: they constantly interact, reinforcing or weakening one another.",
      "Our thoughts are our inner dialogue, what we tell ourselves about what is happening.",
      "They set our perspective — like glasses with particular lenses.",
      "Emotions are our response to how we interpret events and what we think about them.",
      "Joy, sadness, fear, anger — all of these are signals showing how we explain a situation to ourselves.",
      "Our behavior is shaped by our thoughts and emotions.",
      "It is how we act and respond to the world in specific circumstances.",
      "And let’s not forget the body!",
      "It is actively involved in the process and often reacts first.",
      "Thoughts and emotions trigger physical reactions: rapid heartbeat, sweating, muscle tension when anxious; a smile and laughter — when joyful.",
      "It often seems to us that emotions arise directly from events.",
      "The car breaks down — we get angry.",
      "We lose our wallet — we feel upset.",
      "But CBT emphasizes that between the event and the emotion there is a mediator — our thoughts about what happened.",
      "It is the interpretation of the event, not the event itself, that shapes how we feel."

      "I was giving a presentation at work. I was shaking, my voice was breaking. It felt like everyone was looking at me with disapproval.",
      "What thought came up right before your anxiety spiked?",
      "Most likely I thought: “I’m going to mess everything up” or “They’ll think I’m stupid.”",
      "Good. So the thought is: “I’m going to mess everything up.” Emotions: anxiety, fear. Behavior: shaking, a trembling voice.",
      "Now let’s check how accurate this thought is.",
      "Was there real evidence that you ruined everything?",
      "Well… The presentation wasn’t perfect, but it wasn’t a disaster either. My colleagues even asked questions.",
      "So the thought “I’m going to mess everything up” was exaggerated. A more realistic version would be: “I’m nervous, but I can handle it.”",
      "And even if I make a mistake during the presentation, that doesn’t mean I’m stupid. It means I’m human and I’m worried, and I don’t have much experience with public speaking yet.",
      "If you had this kind of supportive thought, how would you feel and how would you behave?",
      "I’d probably feel calmer and behave more confidently.",
