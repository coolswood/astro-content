      "I constantly feel anxious. It seems like I do everything wrong, and people around me judge me.",

      "I was giving a presentation at work. I was shaking, my voice was breaking. I felt like everyone was looking at me with judgment.",
      "What thought crossed your mind just before you started feeling anxious?",
      "I probably thought: \"I will mess everything up.\" \"They will think I’m stupid.\"",
      "Alright. So, the thought: \"I will mess everything up.\" Emotion: Anxiety, fear. Behavior: Shaking, breaking voice.",
      "Now, let’s check how accurate that thought was.",
      "Was there real evidence that you messed everything up?",
      "Well… The presentation wasn’t perfect, but it wasn’t a disaster either. My colleagues even asked questions.",
      "So, your thought \"I will mess everything up\" wasn’t entirely accurate. Maybe a more realistic thought would be: \"I’m nervous, but I can handle it.\"",
      "And even if I make a mistake during the presentation, that doesn’t mean I’m stupid—it just means I’m human. I’m anxious because I lack experience speaking in public.\"",
      "If you had this thought, how would you feel and behave?",
      "I would probably feel much calmer and act more confidently.",
