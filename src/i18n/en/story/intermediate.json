  "title": "Hidden Filters of the Mind: How Intermediate Beliefs Shape Our World",
  "description": "In this article, we look at the concept of intermediate beliefs — the inner rules and assumptions through which we perceive the world. They are linked to automatic thoughts and often determine our emotional state and reactions. Becoming aware of these beliefs and rethinking them helps make our thinking more flexible and supportive.",

      "Now we’re going a little deeper — from the branches down to the trunk of our imaginary tree.",
      "The trunk represents our “intermediate beliefs”.",
      "They are also called “rules” because they are the inner attitudes and filters through which we look at ourselves, other people, and the world.",
      "Here are a few examples of such beliefs:",
      "If I always please others, they will love me.",
      "I need to be strong, otherwise I’ll lose people’s respect and stop being important to them.",
      "If I make a mistake, it means I’m a complete failure.",
      "Notice that these beliefs often sound like conditions. That’s why it’s helpful to phrase them with the word “if”."

      "Most of our beliefs are formed in childhood, while we’re still learning to understand ourselves and the world.",
      "Many of us have heard typical phrases like:",
      "Men don’t cry.",
      "If you don’t eat your porridge, you won’t grow.",
      "And then an adult with the belief “Men don’t cry” can’t allow themselves to show emotion. The feelings that build up can turn into anger or lead to depression.",
      "And the belief about food can become one of the factors behind eating disorders.",
      "That’s why it’s important to pay attention to the beliefs we pass on to children. It’s just as important to notice the beliefs we carry within ourselves.",
      "In therapy, we learn to recognize our intermediate beliefs and check whether they actually help us or, on the contrary, hold us back.",
      "We’ll come back to working with these beliefs more than once. Next, we’ll go even deeper — to the very basic level where everything begins."
