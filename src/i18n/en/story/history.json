  "title": "How CBT Transformed Our Understanding of Psychology",
  "description": "This article looks at the historical roots of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), starting in the 1960s with the work of psychologist Aaron Beck. We briefly outline the key features of CBT in the context of a time when psychoanalysis dominated, and highlight the evidence in favor of this approach.",

      "Let’s take a gentle look back in time and see who stood at the origins of cognitive behavioral therapy and what Sigmund Freud has to do with it – a name without which the history of psychology is hard to imagine.",
      "We won’t dive into exact dates or long lists of facts.",
      "If, after this overview, you want more specifics, you can always look it up on Wikipedia or in specialized sources.",
      "Aaron Beck, the future star of psychology, was born in 1921.",
      "As a child, he was shy, often ill, and very afraid of doctors (which is quite ironic).",
      "Instead of backing away from his fears, he chose to face them: he entered Yale Medical School and then chose psychiatry.",
      "“Fight fire with fire,” young Aaron might have thought as he worked through his fear of blood and spent hours in the operating room.",
      "At first, like many psychiatrists of his time, Beck practiced psychoanalysis.",
      "But soon he noticed that endlessly searching for roots in childhood experiences was like looking for your keys under a streetlamp just because it is brighter there, not because that is where you dropped them.",
      "Beck was drawn to precision, testable hypotheses, and data rather than abstract constructs.",
      "A figure as well-known and influential as Freud hardly needs an introduction, but let’s recall the basic principles of psychoanalysis:",
      "The main focus is on unconscious processes and childhood experiences.",
      "Psychoanalysts explore past traumas, conflicts, and relationship dynamics to understand how they shape current difficulties."

      "The format is an open-ended conversation: the client talks about their thoughts and feelings, and the therapist helps interpret possible unconscious motives.",
      "The process can be very long — sometimes lasting for years.",
      "It is assumed that a significant part of our behavior is driven by unconscious processes, often linked to repressed wishes and conflicts.",
      "“It is a great misconception to think that the roots of psychological problems must necessarily be sought in childhood experiences,” Beck wrote.",
      "“It is much more important to understand what is happening in a person’s life right now, how they see themselves and the world around them, and what patterns of thinking they use.”",
      "Followers of Freud believed that depression is the result of anger turned against the self.",
      "But in the 1960s, working with people with depression, Beck began to notice recurring negative thoughts such as “I’m a failure”, “Nobody loves me”, “The world is a terrible place.”",
      "These thoughts, like a stuck record, were clearly making people’s lives worse.",
      "He asked himself: what if these thoughts are not just a side effect, but one of the key causes of suffering?",
      "Instead of limiting the work to childhood experiences, Beck suggested trying to change the person’s current patterns of thinking.",
      "Beck conducted a series of studies that supported his hypothesis.",
      "He developed questionnaires and methods to identify negative automatic thoughts, and then created cognitive therapy, which teaches people to recognize and challenge these beliefs.",
      "Later, he added behavioral techniques to these cognitive methods – and that is how cognitive behavioral therapy was formed.",
      "Beck proposed focusing on current beliefs and interpretations of everyday events rather than exclusively on childhood conflicts.",
      "He used practical exercises to help people notice and change destructive thoughts.",
      "For example, he recommended keeping diaries to record negative thoughts and then analyze them.",
      "This made it easier to see how often our view of reality is distorted and how strongly that affects our well-being.",
      "Unlike long-term psychoanalysis that could go on for years, Beck’s therapy usually fit into about 12 months and showed strong results.",
      "In one interview, Beck admitted: “After giving up Freud’s method, I immediately felt anxious about my financial security.",
      "After ten sessions, clients would say, ‘Doctor, thank you!",
      "I’ve started to see life differently and to think differently about myself and others.",
      "I don’t need your help anymore!’ – and, after thanking me, they would leave, and my income would drop.”",
      "However, his anxiety soon gave way to confidence: the results spoke for themselves."

    "question": "How does CBT differ from psychoanalysis?",

      "It focuses mainly on childhood trauma",

      "Cognitive therapy, which helped people overcome depression faster and find practical solutions, made Beck well-known enough that he could worry less about money.",
      "The method spread quickly, and by the early 1990s, seeing a cognitive therapist had become almost as common as going to a yoga class.",
      "Of course, psychoanalysis and other approaches did not disappear.",
      "Every person is unique, and no single method suits absolutely everyone.",
      "Many therapists today use an integrative approach, combining elements of psychoanalysis with other techniques.",
      "At the same time, CBT remains one of the most thoroughly researched and evidence-based approaches.",
      "It is used all over the world, and Beck’s name has become iconic among professionals.",
      "His ideas continue to inspire new generations of therapists who help people deal with inner conflicts and choose healthier ways of relating to the world.",
      "Now that you know a bit more about the history, if you are curious, you can continue exploring it on your own.",
      "And for everyone else, we invite you to keep going together with us.",
      "We genuinely value CBT (and that is not just a slogan).",
      "In our work, we rely on a scientific approach: all techniques are grounded in solid evidence.",
      "That is why the next section is devoted to proof of how effective this method is.",
      "Get ready for some numbers!",
      "You have been warned!"
