  "title": "Automatic Thoughts: What Grows in the Garden of Your Mind?",
  "description": "This article delves into the idea of “automatic thoughts” within the realm of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Using an apple tree analogy, the authors illustrate the hierarchy of human beliefs that fuel these automatic responses. The article also explores how different life experiences can shape our initial emotional reactions and thought patterns.",

      "From the previous chapter, we've learned that our thoughts can influence our emotions and physical reactions.",
      "Now, building on these basic concepts, we'll move on to the elements we'll be working with directly.",
      "We spent quite some time thinking about how best to visualize the hierarchy of human beliefs in CBT. Ultimately, we decided that a tree serves as the perfect illustration.",
      "Picture an apple tree in front of you—this represents your mind. At the top, you see fruits: some are ripe and plump, while others are rotten or worm-eaten.",
      "In this analogy, the fruits represent our thoughts.",
      "In CBT, these are called “automatic” thoughts because they arise in our minds quickly and without conscious effort.",
      "They appear in such great numbers and so fleetingly that we often don't even realize they're there."
