  "description": "This article introduces the idea of “automatic thoughts” in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). We use the image of an apple tree to explain the hierarchy of beliefs behind our quick emotional reactions, and show how life experience shapes our first thoughts and feelings.",

      "From the previous chapter, we already know that our thoughts affect our emotions and physical reactions.",
      "Now, building on the basics, let’s turn to what we’ll work with in practice.",
      "We thought about how best to illustrate the hierarchy of beliefs in CBT and concluded that a tree is the clearest image.",
      "Picture an apple tree in front of you. It represents your mind. On its branches hang fruits—some bright and ripe, others bruised or spoiled.",
      "The fruits on this tree are your thoughts.",
      "In CBT, these thoughts are called “automatic” because they appear quickly, almost imperceptibly, and without conscious effort.",
      "There are so many of them—and they’re so fleeting—that we often don’t even notice them appear."

      "On your right is a young man who has recently gone through a long, difficult divorce.",

      "Just as fruits don’t exist apart from the branches, trunk, and roots of a tree, our automatic thoughts rest on intermediate and core beliefs."
