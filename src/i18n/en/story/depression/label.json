      "Labeling is an overly generalizing, negative assessment of oneself or another person, carried out without analytical thinking and often based on a single event or action.",
      "For example:",
      "Late to a meeting – irresponsible",
      "Did something for themselves – selfish",
      "Lying on the couch on their day off – lazy",
      "Failed an exam – stupid",
      "Fired from a job – loser",
      "This resembles a childish habit. Children actively use labels as they learn and explore the world, still knowing little.",
      "They need to quickly organize a volume of new information. An adult, however, is capable of analyzing information before drawing conclusions."

      "Reducing everything to a single label is like trying to describe an entire movie in one frame. Many important details, circumstances, and nuances will be missed.",
      "Labeling yourself is destructive and dysfunctional. Your 'self' cannot be reduced to any single, definitive label. Such a mindset leads to a habit of oversimplification and misunderstanding of oneself.",
      "And when you label others, there is a high probability that your perception of the person will be one-sided.",
      "As a result, this can lead to serious problems in relationships with others, as no one likes to be labeled.",
      "So, what should we do? Look for and consider evidence that contradicts your labels.",
      "For example, someone cuts in front of you in line, and you immediately think they are rude.",
      "Your mood worsens.",
      "In this situation, it's worth considering that the person might have valid reasons to hurry, and it's not right to label them immediately."
