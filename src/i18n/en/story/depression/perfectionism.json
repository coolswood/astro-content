      "Perfectionism can unexpectedly act as both a symptom and a cause of depression.",
      "For many, high standards and demands on themselves and others seem to be the driving force. However, when expectations become unrealistic, they can turn into a trap, leading to a constant feeling of inadequacy, incessant criticism, and, as a result, depression.",
      "\"Perfectionism\" means striving for the ideal. There are different forms of it:",
      "Personality-oriented, or autopersonalism, is characterized by an internal striving for perfection. People of this type may spend sleepless nights rechecking reports for errors, not leave the house because of an insufficiently neat hairstyle, experience deep guilt for the slightest mistakes, and constantly feel not good enough.",
      "Externally oriented perfectionism demands perfection from others, as in the case of parents expecting excellent grades from their children, or a leader demanding impeccable work from their employees.",
      "To understand if you suffer from destructive perfectionism, pay attention to such signs as an unyielding need for perfection, dependence on the opinions of others, fear of disappointing, striving for unattainable goals, inability to accept criticism, and excessive strictness towards yourself and others."

      "Having learned this, you can begin the path to liberation from the shackles of perfectionism, directing your efforts towards achieving realistic goals and learning to find joy in the imperfection of the world and yourself in it.",
      "To fight something, it is important to clearly understand your need for it.",
      "If you consider perfectionism to be useful and do not see anything wrong with it, you are unlikely to be able to achieve change.",
      "Let's start by looking at the advantages and disadvantages of perfectionism.",
      "It certainly has positive aspects, such as high standards for oneself can contribute to hard work. However, when faced with mistakes, you may be too critical of yourself.",
      "There is a distinction between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism.",
      "Adaptive perfectionism can strengthen your perseverance and responsibility, helping you achieve goals without unnecessary self-criticism and fear of failure.",
      "At the same time, maladaptive perfectionism leads to excessive demands on oneself and others, anxiety about any mistake, which can cause anxiety, depression, and procrastination.",
      "The line between these two types is very thin."
