    "description": "This article examines the habit of labeling and explains how oversimplifying people—including ourselves—keeps us from seeing a person’s real complexity. We explore why labels constrain thinking, intensify negative emotions, and damage relationships, and we offer exercises that help cultivate a more holistic, nuanced view of people and the world.",
