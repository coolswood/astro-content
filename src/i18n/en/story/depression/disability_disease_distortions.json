    "description": "The article explores the impact of physical limitations on a person's emotional well-being, highlighting the role of cognitive distortions in perceiving one's own abilities. Through the story of Anna, who faced depression following her husband's disability, a path to emotional recovery through cognitive-behavioral therapy and reevaluating life values is shown. The article concludes with reflections on the importance of focusing on capabilities rather than limitations, urging readers to reassess their views on happiness and self-fulfillment.",

        "At that moment, the person confronts the fact of loss: for example, because of a spinal fracture, they may no longer be able to walk.",
        "Normal life, the customary view of the world - everything can break and disappear in an instant, replaced by pain, fear, and disarray.",
        "The adaptation process to new life circumstances is accompanied by various emotions and states, which psychologists conditionally divide into several stages: denial, depression, acceptance, etc.",
        "Some people might \"get stuck\" at one stage for years, not finding the strength to move to the next, while others may \"skip\" some stages.",
        "Moreover, how each affected person perceives their physical shortcomings varies, depending also on the close people surrounding them, the assistance provided to them, and a multitude of factors.",
        "Friends and relatives usually show understanding and sympathy, considering it the appropriate response. However, such support can also have the opposite effect.",
        "Emotional suffering is often caused not by physical limitations but by distortions in thinking.",
        "In such situations, compassion can produce unwanted effects, intensifying the affected person's self-pity and despair, and reinforcing the belief that a person with a disability is doomed to experience less joy and satisfaction in life than others.",
        "Conversely, when the affected person and their close ones learn to correct distortions in their thinking, they often gain a more fulfilling and joyful emotional life."
