Through the story of Anna—who faced depression after her husband’s disability—it traces a path toward emotional recovery using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and a reevaluation of life values. The article closes by shifting the focus from limitations to possibilities, inviting readers to rethink what happiness and self-realization can look like.",

        "Physical limitations are often seen as problems that feel undeniably “real.”",
        "People who face various limitations due to age or disability—for instance, after an amputation—often fear that this will limit their capacity for happiness.",
        "Disability is an enormous stressor—especially when it happens suddenly, as after a road accident.",
        "In that moment a person confronts loss: a spinal fracture, for example, may mean they can no longer walk.",
        "Everyday life—the familiar picture of the world—can shatter in an instant, replaced by pain, fear, and confusion.",
        "Adapting to new life circumstances comes with a range of emotions and states that psychologists often describe in stages such as denial, depression, acceptance, and so on.",
        "Some people may get “stuck” in one stage for years, while others may “skip” certain stages.",
        "Alongside each person’s unique way of perceiving their limitations, much also depends on loved ones, the support available, and other factors.",
        "Friends and family typically respond with understanding and compassion, which seems appropriate. However, such support can, at times, have the opposite effect.",
        "Emotional suffering is often fueled less by the physical limitations themselves and more by cognitive distortions.",
        "In such cases, compassion can unintentionally intensify self-pity and despair, reinforcing the belief that a person with a disability is destined to experience less joy and satisfaction than others.",
        "Conversely, when a person and their loved ones learn to correct distorted thinking, they often regain a fuller, more joyful emotional life."

        "By the time Anna turned to a CBT therapist, she was in a severe depression and believed her problems were unsolvable.",
        "Through tears she described the disappointment she felt trying to cope with her husband’s reduced mobility: “Every time I see other couples doing things we can’t, I feel unbearably sad.",
        "I watch families who walk together, travel, ride bikes—and it hurts. For us, doing any of that would be incredibly difficult.",

        "The solution turned out to be surprisingly simple: together with her therapist, they made a list of everything Anna and Roman could do together.",
        "Instead of focusing only on what they couldn’t do, they began to notice opportunities for shared time. Let’s look at their dialogue:",
        "So, Anna, what do you and your husband do—or could you do—together?",
        "Well, we still enjoy each other’s company. We go out to dinner, and we’re a big source of support for one another.",

        "For example, you said you can’t go to the seaside and walk the beach, and you mentioned how much you’d like to swim. What if you planned a trip and chose a quieter place so you wouldn’t feel self-conscious?",

        "To maintain progress, she will of course need to keep working—challenging thoughts and reshaping thinking habits—but she’s willing and motivated, which is crucial in treating depression.",
        "It’s important to understand that we do not minimize physical limitations—far from it. Rather, we recognize how vital it is, in these difficult circumstances, to learn to focus on what you can do instead of what you can’t.",
        "For example, imagine you very much want to fly to the Moon.",

It tells the story of Olga, whose life changed abruptly after a suspected cancer diagnosis, and how she grappled with depression and loss of meaning through work with a psychologist. In the end, Olga recognizes her inherent self-worth and the importance of small accomplishments, which helps restore her self-esteem and shift her emotional state despite physical suffering.",

        "Second — and even more important — she realized her personal worth had been constant and resilient; it was a given, independent of achievements.",
        "This understanding showed her she didn’t need to “earn” her human value, and that even in a weakened state she remained just as worthy.",
        "Recognizing this significantly reduced her depressive symptoms. It didn’t remove the tumor, pain, or physical suffering, but it restored her wounded self-esteem and substantially shifted her emotional state."
