        "Perfectionism can unexpectedly act as both a symptom and a cause of depression.",
        "For many, high standards and demands on oneself and others can feel like a driving force. However, when expectations become unrealistic, they can turn into a trap—leading to a constant sense of not measuring up, relentless criticism, and, ultimately, depression.",
        "“Perfectionism” means striving for the ideal. It takes different forms:",
        "Self-oriented perfectionism is marked by an inner push toward flawlessness. People of this type may spend sleepless nights rechecking reports for errors, avoid leaving home because their hair isn’t neat enough, feel deep guilt over minor slips, and chronically feel “not good enough.”",
        "Other-oriented perfectionism demands perfection from others—like parents expecting top grades from their children or a manager insisting on impeccable performance from employees.",
        "To understand whether you’re dealing with maladaptive perfectionism, watch for signs such as an uncompromising need for perfection, dependence on others’ opinions, fear of disappointing people, pursuit of unattainable goals, intolerance of criticism, and excessive strictness toward yourself and others."

        "Once you grasp this, you can begin freeing yourself from perfectionism’s grip—shifting your efforts toward realistic goals and learning to find joy in the world’s and your own imperfections.",
        "To change anything, it helps to be clear about why you need that change.",
        "If you view perfectionism as purely helpful and see nothing problematic about it, meaningful change is unlikely.",

        "It certainly has upsides—high standards can encourage diligent work. But when faced with mistakes, you may turn that same standard into harsh self-criticism.",
        "There’s a difference between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism.",
        "Adaptive perfectionism can strengthen persistence and responsibility, helping you reach goals without needless self-criticism or fear of mistakes.",
        "Maladaptive perfectionism, in turn, breeds excessive demands on yourself and others and anxiety about any misstep, which can lead to anxiety, depression, and procrastination.",

        "If the task feels easy, give it a low rating—say, 10 or 20%. If it feels harder, 80 or 90% may be appropriate.",
