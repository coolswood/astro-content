        "For many, high standards and demands on themselves and others seem to be the driving force. However, when expectations become unrealistic, they can turn into a trap, leading to a constant feeling of inadequacy, incessant criticism, and, as a result, depression.",
        "\"Perfectionism\" means striving for the ideal. There are different forms of it:",
        "Personality-oriented, or autopersonalism, is characterized by an internal striving for perfection. People of this type may spend sleepless nights rechecking reports for errors, not leave the house because of an insufficiently neat hairstyle, experience deep guilt for the slightest mistakes, and constantly feel not good enough.",
        "Externally oriented perfectionism demands perfection from others, as in the case of parents expecting excellent grades from their children, or a leader demanding impeccable work from their employees.",
        "To understand if you suffer from destructive perfectionism, pay attention to such signs as an unyielding need for perfection, dependence on the opinions of others, fear of disappointing, striving for unattainable goals, inability to accept criticism, and excessive strictness towards yourself and others."

The author elucidates how this distortion leads to misconceptions about how we are perceived by others and its impact on our emotional state and interpersonal relationships. The article concludes with strategies to counter this trend, including self-awareness and open communication, to enhance mutual understanding and emotional well-being.",

        "We often make mistakes by not realizing what the other person is actually thinking or why they acted in a certain way.",
