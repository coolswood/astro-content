    "title": "But What If My Problems Are Real?",
    "description": "The article discusses the difference between depression and natural sadness, emphasizing that depression is always linked to distorted thinking, while sadness is a normal reaction to real events. The author explains that even serious life problems do not directly lead to depression, but affect our emotional state through the filter of our thoughts. It is highlighted that understanding and correcting distorted thoughts can significantly aid in coping with depression, distinguishing it from natural sadness caused by life circumstances.",

It drags a person into a world devoid of joy and light.",

The first was the Beck Depression Inventory, a time-tested self-assessment scale that patients complete without outside help. The second was the Hamilton Depression Scale, filled out with trained depression researchers.",
