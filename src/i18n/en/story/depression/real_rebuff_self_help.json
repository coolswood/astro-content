    "title": "What If My Problems Are Real?",
    "description": "This article discusses the difference between depression and natural sadness, emphasizing that depression is always linked to distorted thinking, while sadness is a normal response to real events. It clarifies that even serious life problems do not directly cause depression; they affect our emotional state through the filter of our thoughts. Understanding and correcting distorted thoughts can greatly help in coping with depression, separating it from natural sadness brought on by life’s circumstances.",

        "We’re not minimizing these hardships—far from it. However, in CBT terms, there is no such thing as a “realistic depression.”",

        "These feelings are natural, justified, and even valuable: they help us process events and grow.",
        "Depression, by contrast, is an illness in which distorted thinking plays a central role.",
        "If, in a similar situation, we start telling ourselves, “I will never be happy again because they died. It’s unfair,” such thoughts fuel self-pity and despair. Emotions grounded in distortion are destructive.",
        "After a loss, illness, breakup, divorce, or a major setback, we may experience either depression or sadness.",
        "But sadness itself is not distorted.",
        "It reflects a natural emotional process and is therefore temporary. Sadness is not tied to a collapse in self-esteem.",
        "Depression is more prolonged; symptoms can intensify. It persists most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two consecutive weeks. Nothing distracts from bleak thoughts, nothing brings joy, life feels colorless—and there is typically a loss of self-worth.",

        "If depression begins after a particular event, that event acts as a trigger—not the sole cause of the disorder.",
        "The mind was already vulnerable; it only needed a small impulse to set the mechanism in motion.",
        "When something truly bad happens, your emotional state is shaped by your interpretations.",
        "Your feelings are linked to how you perceive what’s happening. Much of the suffering stems from cognitive distortions.",
