        "We now understand that a person's psychological state is closely linked to their thinking. In a state of depression, we tend to distort facts, as if looking at the world through grey glass: it appears less bright than through a clear one.",
        "Depression warps our ability to see the world objectively, adding elements to our perception that do not contribute to improving mental health and optimism. Today, we will discuss some of these features.",
        "We talk about cognitive distortions, also known as thinking errors, a key element in cognitive-behavioral therapy.",
        "To understand cognitive errors, let's examine what cognition is. It's the ability to recognize, comprehend, and process information received through the senses.",
        "Cognition helps us perceive, understand, and remember the world around us, as well as make decisions and solve problems.",
        "In short, cognition is the cognitive process involving thoughts, images, representations.",
        "Thus, cognitive distortions are errors in thinking that occur when processing information in the brain, hindering logical thinking.",
        "These are distortions in the interpretation of the meaning of events, when a person's view of reality does not match the facts and reality itself."

        "In this course, we will examine in detail the three most common errors. Let's start with the 'ought-to-be' distortion.",
        "Ought-to-be consists of rigid beliefs about what should or should not happen. These beliefs generate demands on oneself, others, and the world.",
        "This distortion is extremely common: we create a rigid model of the world, and when reality does not meet these standards, we experience negative emotions.",
        "Examples of ought-to-be thinking:",
        "I must be liked by everyone",
        "I must not make mistakes",
        "I must control everything",
        "A man must provide for his family",
        "People around me must be attentive and polite",
        "The word 'must' implies a lack of alternatives, although in reality they often exist. Ought-to-be thinking creates an illusion of a perfect world, and when we step beyond its boundaries, we face harsh reality.",
        "This distortion deprives us of choice, setting a condition: either act in a certain way or experience feelings of guilt and other unpleasant emotions.",
        "What is the danger of ought-to-be thinking? In adaptive thinking, a discrepancy between representations and reality does not cause problems, as a person understands that not all desires are achievable.",
        "However, in maladaptive thinking, one's model of the world carries more weight than reality. The model is perceived as absolute, and reality as erroneous."

        "The second step is challenging. Ask yourself: 'Why do I believe it must be this way?' and 'What evidence is there that it must be so?'",
        "The third step is seeking alternatives. Replace 'must' with 'would like to' or 'it would be nice'. For example:",
        "'It would be nice if my partner did what I consider right. But they have the right to their own view of reality'",
        "'I would like to be flawless. But I am a living person and can be imperfect'",

The authors differentiate between healthy and unhealthy guilt, discussing how the former can motivate positive changes, whereas the latter often leads to self-isolation and a deepening of depression. Strategies for developing self-awareness and correcting unhealthy guilt to improve emotional well-being are proposed.",

        "Depression accompanied by guilt can convince a person that they are unworthy of life, that they have caused irreparable harm to someone, or that others would be better off without them.",
        "The relationship between guilt and depression is bidirectional, meaning the possibility of one arising from the other and vice versa.",
        "Frequently experiencing guilt can contribute to the development of a depressive state in an individual.",
        "Indeed, it is challenging to live and maintain a good emotional state when you constantly blame yourself for everything that happens: your problems, circumstances, and relationships with others.",
        "Such an attitude towards oneself, pattern of thoughts, and accompanying guilt can persist for years, sometimes throughout one's entire life.",
        "A person may come to the conclusion, for certain reasons, that they failed to handle a situation, although they should have. Or that they should have acted differently, felt, and experienced the situation differently.",
        "If this conclusion solidifies for some reason, and if guilt becomes a frequent 'guest', a person can develop full-blown depression.",
        "Depression can also be a reaction to 'chronic problems'. A person attempts to cope with them, but for certain reasons, may lack the necessary experience and skills to solve them.",

        "Thus, the perception of one's own 'defectiveness' is the main cause of guilt.",
        "Being in a state of depression, an individual often experiences guilt, blaming themselves for almost everything: from a lack of strength and motivation to the inability to experience joy and pleasure from life.",
        "A person may also blame themselves for becoming ill with depression, seeing it as a sign of their 'wrongness'.",
        "Sometimes, close ones might also blame the individual, reproaching them for laziness and urging them to stop 'suffering nonsense', which only exacerbates the depressive state.",
        "Depressive guilt can arise even in situations that do not violate moral norms, causing an individual to feel guilty where there is no guilt.",
        "Under the influence of depression, an individual may focus only on their mistakes, forgetting their successes and achievements.",
