        "“Should” statements are rigid beliefs about what must or must not happen. They create demands toward ourselves, others, and the world.",

        "I must not make mistakes",
        "I must keep everything under control",
        "A man must provide for the family",
        "People around me must be attentive and polite",
        "The word “should” implies there’s no alternative—even though alternatives often exist. “Should” statements create an illusion of a perfect world, and stepping outside that illusion confronts us with a harsher reality.",
        "This distortion narrows our choices, setting a condition: either act a certain way or feel guilty and distressed.",
        "Why is this harmful? With adaptive thinking, the gap between expectations and reality isn’t catastrophic, because we understand not every wish can be fulfilled.",

        "For various reasons, a person may conclude that they failed in a situation when they “should” have succeeded—or that they should have acted, felt, or experienced it differently.",
        "If this conclusion becomes reinforced—if guilt becomes a frequent “visitor”—a full depressive episode may develop.",
