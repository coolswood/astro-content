      "Cognitive-behavioral therapy has had a significant impact on the development of psychotherapy and our understanding of depression. We can now confidently state that the negative state experienced in depression is a consequence of distorted negative thinking.",

      "At the heart of depressive states are irrational pessimistic views.",
      "These irrational thoughts can be categorized and divided into types, known as 'cognitive distortions'.",
      "Cognitive distortions manifest in the following ways:",
      "Often, global conclusions are drawn from individual events: a single mistake is seen as evidence of one's incompetence, a single failure as an inability to achieve success in the future. Thoughts like 'I can't do anything, I can't cope with anything, everything is bad' are common in depression.",
      "Similarly, people tend to predict their future in a negative light, seeing it in the darkest tones. Thoughts like 'I've already seen a psychologist, and it didn't help, so no one will' or 'I will always be alone, unable to arrange my life, and be unhappy' are typical of a depressive state.",
      "You'll agree, it's hard to remain cheerful and maintain a good mood with such a pessimistic outlook on life.",
      "However, there is good news: your thoughts are the key to freedom from depression. Learning to recognize and correct negative thoughts can change your mood and overall state."
