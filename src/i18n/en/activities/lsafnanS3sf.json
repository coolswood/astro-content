    "In the evening, before the next day, sit down and write your schedule for the day.",
    "In the basic version, we suggest filling out 4 columns:",
    "1️⃣ First column — «Time». Approximate time for task completion. It can be a time interval.",
    "2️⃣ Second column — «Before». This is an hourly plan of what you want to do. Don't write too much at once: in each hourly row, write one or two words indicating an activity or task.",
    "For example, it can be something small: taking a shower, having breakfast, doing laundry. Or it can be something more energy-consuming: cleaning 🧹, preparing for an exam 🧪, writing a resume ✍🏼, etc.",
    "3️⃣ At the end of each day, write in the third column — «After».",
    "Here, you should record what you actually did throughout the day. Your activities may match your plans or differ — that's okay, don't worry.",
    "Even if you manage to complete just a small part of your 'Before' list, simply planning your day can be a very useful and visually clear process.",
    "4️⃣ Fourth column — «Enjoyment». Even routine tasks can bring enjoyment.",
    "Most importantly, the act of moving forward already provides a certain level of satisfaction. Rate on a 10-point scale how enjoyable the task was for you."
