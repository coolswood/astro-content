      "The test is based on the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26), which was developed by the Clark Institute of Psychiatry in Toronto in 1979. The test is widely used by psychiatrists and psychotherapists around the world for the diagnosis of eating disorders. The EAT-26 test was primarily designed to identify anorexia and bulimia, but it also helps to detect other issues, including restrictive and compulsive overeating. Despite this, we advise in any case to discuss the test results with a pscyhologist and not to make the diagnosis on your own."
