      "The self-assessment test for anxiety disorders, developed at Duke University under the leadership of William Zang, is a unique tool capable of accurately measuring the level of various phobias, panic attacks, and other anxiety disorders. The ZARS scale (Zung Anxiety Rating Scale) not only helps to determine the degree of anxiety but also to understand how deeply these conditions affect a person's daily life. Despite this, we advise in any case to discuss the test results with a pscyhologist and not to make the diagnosis on your own."
