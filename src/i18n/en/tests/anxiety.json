      "text": "How easily a person gets upset or panics can be linked to increased sensitivity to stress. This state is often associated with a low threshold of arousal in the nervous system, which makes a person more vulnerable to external and internal stimuli.",
      "fact": "Studies show that about 2–3% of the adult population worldwide experience panic disorder each year. Women are about twice as likely as men to develop this condition."

      "text": "Headaches and pain in the neck and back can be caused by many factors, including muscle tension, stress, poor posture, prolonged sitting or an uncomfortable position when working at a computer. These pains can also be symptoms of anxiety, which increases muscle tension and heightens the perception of pain."

      "text": "Dizziness can be a direct symptom of an anxiety disorder. During heightened anxiety the autonomic nervous system is activated, which leads to changes in blood circulation and, as a result, to feelings of light-headedness or dizziness.",
      "fact": "Dizzy spells linked to anxiety can make it difficult to carry out everyday tasks, take part in social events or work. This can create a vicious cycle where anxiety about symptoms intensifies the anxiety itself, maintaining or worsening the condition."

      "text": "Fainting or feeling as if you are about to lose consciousness can be associated with vasovagal syncope, a condition in which an excessive activation of the parasympathetic nervous system in response to stress causes a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate. This is often seen in people with anxiety disorders.",
      "fact": "During acute anxiety or panic attacks, hyperventilation (rapid breathing) often occurs. This can lower the level of carbon dioxide in the blood and, as a result, lead to dizziness or loss of consciousness."
    },
    "12": {
      "text": "Free and deep breathing plays a key role in regulating the nervous system, helping to reduce stress and anxiety. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes relaxation and decreases heart rate.",
      "fact": "Studies show that breathing exercises can reduce the production of stress hormones in the body and improve overall mental health. Regular practice can help achieve a deeper level of relaxation and lower everyday tension."

    "13": {
      "text": "Numbness and tingling in the extremities can be related to anxiety, especially when they occur during panic attacks or periods of intense stress. These symptoms are often caused by hyperventilation, which leads to changes in blood flow and carbon dioxide levels in the blood, resulting in a temporary sensation of numbness or tingling.",
      "fact": "Although these symptoms are usually temporary, they can be worrying or frightening, especially when the cause is unknown. This can intensify anxiety, creating a vicious circle."

    },
    "15": {
      "text": "Frequent urges to urinate can be one of the physical symptoms of anxiety. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system in response to stress can increase activity of the bladder and urinary tract, which leads to more frequent urination.",
      "fact": "Research shows that frequent urges to urinate are found in a significant proportion of people with anxiety disorders. It is important to discuss these symptoms with a doctor to rule out other possible medical causes and to receive appropriate treatment for anxiety."

      "text": "Facial flushing can be caused by anxiety and stress, which trigger the release of adrenaline. This hormone dilates blood vessels and increases blood flow to the facial skin, leading to redness.",
      "fact": "In moments of anxiety or stress, the facial blood vessels can expand, causing redness known as flushing. This is a natural bodily response to emotional tension and may be accompanied by a feeling of heat or burning."
