      "text": "According to the American Psychological Association, praise — especially when it focuses on effort rather than outcome — helps develop a stable sense of self-worth. It supports a more positive self-view and reduces the fear of failure.",
      "fact": "J. K. Rowling, the author of \"Harry Potter\", often recalls that it was the support and praise from her literature teachers at school that helped her believe in her writing abilities, despite difficulties in her personal life and numerous rejections from publishers at the beginning of her career."

      "fact": "In Stoic philosophy, one of the central ideas is the ability to maintain inner calm and a sense of dignity despite external circumstances. Stoics such as Seneca and Marcus Aurelius taught that a person’s true value is determined not by successes and failures, but by their inner qualities and moral principles."

      "text": "In psychology there is a concept called the “halo effect”, where one positive trait of a person, such as success or attractiveness, leads us to perceive them as more valuable in many other areas. This cognitive distortion often results in unfair evaluations of people.",
      "fact": "In different eras and societies, a person’s value has been judged by different criteria: origin, wealth, achievements, or moral qualities. For example, in aristocratic societies people from higher classes were considered “more valuable” purely because of their birth. This led to social inequality and discrimination."

      "text": "The concept of a “growth mindset”, proposed by psychologist Carol Dweck, states that people with this mindset see mistakes and failures as opportunities for learning and development. Such people usually don’t let mistakes define their self-esteem and keep moving forward despite temporary difficulties.",
      "fact": "Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, went through a major failure when he was fired from his own company. However, he did not allow this mistake to change his attitude toward himself. Instead, he founded a new company, which eventually brought him back to Apple, where he created some of the most successful products in history."

      "text": "Psychologists note that for many people self-esteem is closely tied to how they are seen by others, especially by significant others (family, friends, partners). A study from the University of Houston found that around 70% of people admit that their sense of self-worth increases when they feel loved and supported by important people in their lives.",
      "fact": "According to attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby, people with secure attachment in childhood (when they felt loved and protected) later develop a more stable sense of self-worth. Those who experienced a lack of love and attachment often feel a strong need for external recognition to compensate for this deficit."

A study from the University of Rochester found that after achieving a goal, happiness levels tend to return to their baseline within a few months. This phenomenon is known as “hedonic adaptation”.",
      "fact": "Jim Carrey, the well-known actor and comedian, has shared that even though he achieved all his career goals, it did not make him truly happy. He noted that happiness depends not only on external accomplishments, but also on one’s inner state and the ability to enjoy the present moment."

      "text": "Philosophy often explores what makes a person “good”. One approach is virtue ethics, proposed by Aristotle, which states that a person is considered good if they cultivate virtues in different areas of life. However, this requires constant work on oneself and does not guarantee that success in one domain automatically means virtue in all others.",
      "fact": "People are complex and multifaceted, and success or virtue in one area does not necessarily mean virtue in every aspect of life. Studies indicate that personality traits and moral characteristics can vary greatly depending on context and situation."

      "text": "Basing self-worth on comparison with others can lead to what is called “contingent self-esteem”, when a sense of worth depends strongly on external factors such as approval or success. This can create unstable self-esteem that fluctuates with circumstances and social environment.",
      "fact": "Social media amplifies the tendency for social comparison by creating the illusion of “perfect lives” in other people. Research shows that frequent use of social networks is associated with lower self-esteem, especially among adolescents and young adults. This happens because people tend to compare their real lives with carefully curated and edited images and achievements of others."

      "text": "People often use psychological defense mechanisms when receiving negative feedback because it can threaten their self-esteem. One common reaction to criticism is “defensive behavior”, when a person tries to justify themselves or reject the criticism in order to preserve their sense of self-worth. Studies show that this reaction is found in about 60–70% of people.",
      "fact": "Mark Twain, the famous writer, was known for his vivid reaction to criticism. He once said, “I can live for two months on a good compliment.” This highlights how strongly praise and criticism can influence a person’s self-perception and how hard it sometimes is to accept negative feedback."

This relates to the concept of “contingent self-esteem”, when a sense of dignity depends on achievements and recognition. Studies show that about 40% of people in Western cultures are often motivated by this desire to prove their value.",
      "fact": "Contingent self-esteem can be unstable because it depends on reaching goals and receiving recognition. People whose self-esteem rests on external factors often experience emotional ups and downs and anxiety when they fail to achieve their goals. At the same time, reaching these goals can temporarily boost their self-esteem."

Research shows that perfectionists experience strong feelings of inadequacy and a drop in self-esteem if they fail to meet their high standards. Around 30% of people with pronounced perfectionism suffer from anxiety disorders and depression because they cannot accept their failures.",
      "fact": "John Kennedy Toole, the author of \"A Confederacy of Dunces\", long considered himself a failure because he could not get his novel published. This greatly affected his self-esteem and ultimately led to tragic consequences. After his death, however, the novel was published and became a bestseller, winning the Pulitzer Prize — a reminder that failure in one area does not define the overall value of a person."

      "text": "Viewing a person’s value mainly through the lens of success can create enormous pressure on those who try to meet very high standards. Research shows that striving for success purely to feel valuable in society’s eyes can lead to burnout and lower overall life satisfaction. This mindset can also reduce a person’s ability to accept failures and learn from them.",
      "fact": "Different cultures use different criteria to assess a person’s value, but in many Western societies professional success is a key marker of worth. Studies show that in individualistic cultures such as the USA and the UK, a person’s value is closely tied to career achievements. In more collectivist cultures, such as Japan or China, greater importance is placed on family and social connections."

      "fact": "A study from the University of Michigan found that people who avoid comparing themselves to others are 30% less likely to experience depression and anxiety. They are also 40% more likely to report high life satisfaction and self-esteem. This confirms that stepping away from social comparison supports better psychological well-being."

Studies show that about 70% of people experience a drop in self-esteem after being criticized, particularly when the criticism comes from someone important to them. This happens because people tend to internalise negative comments, which can lead to self-criticism and reduced confidence.",
      "fact": "Cognitive distortions such as “all-or-nothing thinking” and “overgeneralisation” can intensify the negative impact of criticism. For example, a person may start to think that if they failed at one task, they are a failure in general. This distortion can sharply lower self-esteem and undermine confidence in their abilities."

This concept is especially emphasized in humanistic psychology, where founders such as Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow argued that a person’s value should be taken as a given, not something to be rated or compared.",
      "fact": "Mahatma Gandhi often said that a person’s worth cannot be measured or diminished by others. He believed that everyone deserves respect and dignity regardless of their status or achievements, and this belief became the foundation of his philosophy of nonviolence and struggle for equality."
