Scrupulousness, pedantry, and the manic desire to clean everything and do things 'the right way' are common companions of severe OCD. You may skip certain rituals and rationalize your anxiety in certain situations, but you probably understand that you only partially control it.

For example, you believe that if you perform a certain action several times, it will somehow improve your condition, even if it contradicts common sense. You find it extremely difficult to control and stop repetitive behavior. If other people try to change the 'established order', it causes irritation and anger. You feel a vague threat if you do not perform the rituals. This may manifest in various phobias: fear of getting sick and dying or premonition of an accident that might happen to you or your loved ones. You probably also suffer from nervous tics, strange allergies, dermatitis, are painfully sensitive to bright light and loud noises, constantly scratch your skin, etc.",
