      "text": "Psychologist Martin Seligman first described the phenomenon of learned helplessness, when a person starts to believe they cannot change their situation, even when real opportunities exist. This pattern is often seen in people who have faced repeated failures or negative life events.",
      "fact": "Former UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill went through many setbacks in his political career, including election defeats and heavy criticism. His persistence and belief in his abilities, however, helped him overcome adversity and eventually become one of the most influential leaders in history."

      "text": "Feeling uncertain about the future is very common. Studies show that many people struggle with long-term planning, especially in a fast-changing world.",
      "fact": "Psychologists sometimes call this “future fuzziness”: the further away an event is in time, the less clear and concrete it feels. This is normal — people usually have a much clearer sense of the near future than of distant years."

    "6": {
      "text": "Psychologists note that negative thinking can be both a cause and a consequence of depression. People with chronic pessimism tend to see the future in dark colours, which can further worsen their mental state.",
      "fact": "Cognitive distortions such as catastrophizing (grossly exaggerating negative outcomes) and black-and-white thinking (seeing situations only in extreme terms) strongly contribute to a bleak view of the future."
    },
    "7": {
      "text": "People who expect luck and success often create the conditions for them. This is partly related to a self-fulfilling prophecy: when people believe in their success, they act more decisively and openly, which increases their chances of achieving what they want.",
      "fact": "Carl Jung introduced the term “synchronicity” to describe meaningful coincidences that feel like good fortune. People often interpret these events as signs that they are moving in the right direction."

    "8": {
      "text": "Martin Seligman coined the term learned helplessness to describe a state in which people come to believe they cannot change their situation, even when they actually can. This often develops after repeated failures or long periods of stress.",
      "fact": "Research shows that a persistent sense of “bad luck” can be linked to cognitive biases such as confirmation bias (looking only for evidence that supports negative beliefs) and dismissing positive events as “just a fluke”."

      "text": "Psychologists emphasize that past experience plays a crucial role in shaping our behavior and expectations. Trial and error are central to learning and growth. People who can learn from their mistakes are typically more successful in the long run.",

    },
    "11": {
      "text": "Psychologists point out that expectations strongly shape our actions and outcomes. If a person does not expect to get what they want, this can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: they may unconsciously avoid actions that could lead to success.",

    "14": {
      "text": "Psychologists refer to this as the expectation effect or Pygmalion effect. People who believe in a successful future act with more purpose and persistence, which increases the likelihood of reaching their goals. Their positive expectations shape their behaviour and help create conditions for success.",
      "fact": "A Harvard study found that optimists live on average 11–15% longer than pessimists. This is partly because optimists cope better with stress and are more likely to maintain healthy habits."

      "text": "Psychologists distinguish between an internal and an external locus of control. People with an internal locus of control believe they can influence their life and achievements, whereas those with an external locus of control attribute success and failure mainly to external circumstances. Developing an internal locus of control can help people feel more confident and capable.",

      "fact": "The human brain is capable of change and adaptation throughout life — a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. Even if someone is used to thinking negatively, deliberate practice and new habits can gradually shift thinking patterns toward a more positive and flexible view of possibilities and the future."

      "text": "Psychologists have found that fear of failure often paralyzes people and keeps them from pursuing their goals.
