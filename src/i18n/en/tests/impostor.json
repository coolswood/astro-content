      "fact": "Emma Watson, a well-known actor and activist, has spoken openly about feeling like an impostor. Despite her success in film and public work, she has often doubted her abilities and feared that others would discover her “not being good enough”."

      "text": "Feeling that you come across as more competent than you believe yourself to be is a hallmark of impostor syndrome. People with this pattern often feel that their success is undeserved and fear being “found out”.",
      "fact": "According to the American Psychological Association, around 25% of office workers feel less competent than their colleagues believe them to be."
    },

      "text": "Fear of having your work evaluated is a common sign of impostor syndrome. People with this experience often worry that their work will turn out to be “not good enough”.",
      "fact": "Fear of evaluation can lead to procrastination and avoiding tasks that require feedback or review, which in turn reinforces self-doubt and self-criticism."

    "3": {
      "text": "Being able to accept praise and acknowledge your achievements is an important step in overcoming impostor syndrome. Psychologists recommend regularly reminding yourself of your successes and learning to accept compliments without arguing with them internally.",
      "fact": "In surveys of students at highly selective universities, about 60% reported feeling less confident in their abilities after receiving positive grades or praise."
    },
    "4": {
      "text": "Recognising your skills and hard work is a key step in reducing impostor feelings. People who regularly review and acknowledge their own successes are less likely to experience strong impostor syndrome.",
      "fact": "Tina Fey, a well-known comedian and writer, has repeatedly mentioned her impostor feelings. She often thought her success in comedy and television was just luck. In her book “Bossypants”, she shares her doubts and fears, showing that even highly successful people can feel out of place."

    },
    "6": {
      "text": "People with impostor syndrome often focus on their failures and minimise or ignore their successes. This is linked to cognitive distortions such as a negative mental filter and “discounting the positives”.",
      "fact": "Michelle Obama, former First Lady of the United States, has talked about her own impostor feelings and tendency to dwell on failures. In her book “Becoming”, she describes how she struggled with the idea that her success was random and undeserved, and how she gradually learned to acknowledge and value her achievements."
    },
    "7": {
      "text": "Feeling dissatisfied with your work and constantly striving for something better is common among people with impostor syndrome. They often set unrealistically high standards for themselves, which makes it difficult to feel that a project is “good enough”.",
      "fact": "Perfectionism can strongly reinforce impostor feelings. People who always strive for the ideal often experience high anxiety and a strong fear of failure, which prevents them from appreciating what they have already accomplished."
    },
    "8": {
      "text": "This cognitive distortion is sometimes called the “illusion of randomness”: success is seen as a fluke rather than the result of competence and effort. It is closely linked to low self-esteem and harsh self-criticism.",
      "fact": "Albert Einstein, one of the most influential scientists in history, spoke at times about feeling like an impostor. Despite his outstanding contributions, he considered many of his successes to be due to luck and believed people overestimated his abilities."

    },
    "10": {

      "fact": "External success and recognition do not necessarily make impostor feelings disappear. Even people at the top of their professions can continue to feel like “frauds”."
    },
    "11": {
      "text": "Again, difficulties accepting praise are closely tied to impostor syndrome. Compliments can trigger discomfort or embarrassment instead of joy, because they contradict the person’s internal, more critical self-image.",
      "fact": "Studies show that many professionals tend to brush off praise with phrases like “It was nothing” or “Anyone could have done it”, which reinforces the habit of discounting their own achievements."
    },
    "12": {
      "text": "People with impostor syndrome are often genuinely highly capable, but their inner beliefs do not match reality. They underestimate their knowledge and skills, which keeps them in a state of ongoing tension and self-doubt.",

    },
    "14": {
      "text": "Doubting your ability to repeat success, even after recognised achievements, is related to cognitive distortions such as impostor syndrome and the “expert paradox”, where highly competent people see their success as fragile or accidental.",
      "fact": "This pattern is also connected to the Dunning–Kruger effect: people with high competence tend to underestimate their abilities, whereas less competent people often overestimate theirs. Those with impostor syndrome usually fall into the first group."
    },
    "15": {
      "text": "The tendency to downplay your achievements, even in the face of praise and recognition, is an example of the cognitive distortion known as “disqualifying the positive”. People with this pattern ignore or devalue their successes.",
      "fact": "Psychologists often recommend intentionally acknowledging your accomplishments — for example, by keeping a success journal or talking through achievements with someone you trust — to counteract the habit of dismissing them."
    },
    "16": {
      "text": "Constantly comparing yourself with others can lead to a sense of chronic “not enough”, where attention is focused only on your own perceived shortcomings and not on your strengths.",

    },
    "19": {
      "text": "The drive to be “the best” can lead to burnout and chronic stress. People with impostor syndrome often work harder and longer than necessary to meet their own high standards, which can harm their mental and physical health.",
      "fact": "Serena Williams, one of the most successful tennis players in history, has spoken about her intense need to stay at the top and about impostor-like feelings. Despite her many titles and victories, she has often felt pressure always to perform perfectly and feared not meeting expectations."
