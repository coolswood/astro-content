      "text": "Accelerated speech or logorrhea often occurs in the manic phase of bipolar disorder. It's not just an acceleration of speech, but also an increase in the number of words spoken per unit of time. Sometimes such speech becomes so fast that others can't keep up with the conversation, leading to communication difficulties.",
      "fact": "Studies show that accelerated speech during manic episodes can be linked to increased activity in certain areas of the brain, such as the frontal lobes. These brain areas are important for planning and producing speech, as well as regulating emotions."

      "text": "One of the symptoms of the manic phase of bipolar disorder is accelerated thinking, known as \"thought racing\" or \"idea flow.\" This is a state where thoughts replace each other at high speed, making it difficult for the person to focus on a single task.",

      "Bipolar disorder is a mental condition characterized by sharp mood swings from extremely elevated (mania) to deeply depressed (depression), which can occur without any apparent external cause. These mood fluctuations are often accompanied by significant changes in energy, activity, sleep, and behavior.",
      "For example, during a manic episode, an individual may feel super energetic, need minimal sleep, and exhibit impulsive behavior such as thoughtless spending or risky decisions. During a depressive period, the same individual may experience deep sadness, loss of interest in usual activities, and severe fatigue.",
      "Please note when answering the test questions that symptoms must last more than 2 days! Everyone experiences periods of high activity, but with bipolar disorder, the period is long, and the activity is extremely high. If your behavior differed from the norm only briefly, answer 'no'."
