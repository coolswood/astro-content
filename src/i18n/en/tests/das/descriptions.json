  "approval": [
    "The “Approval” scale measures how strongly a person ties their self-respect to other people’s opinions. A positive score from 0 to 10 indicates that the person maintains independence, has a healthy sense of self-worth, and responds to criticism and disapproval in a balanced way.",
    "A negative score from -10 to 0 indicates that a person is strongly dependent on how others see them. When criticized, they tend to see themselves as worthless. This emotional hypersensitivity to other people’s opinions makes them especially vulnerable to manipulation."
  ],
  "love": [
    "The “Love” scale measures how much a person depends on being loved by others. A positive score shows that love is important and desirable, but not their only source of interest and meaning in life.",
    "They do not see love as a prerequisite for happiness or self-respect, which often makes them more attractive in other people’s eyes — they care about themselves and are genuinely interested in different areas of life.",
    "A negative score points to a strong dependence on love, seeing it as essential for happiness and even for psychological survival.",
    "The closer the result is to -10, the stronger the dependence on love and the greater the tendency to take a submissive position out of fear of rejection. This leads to a loss of self-respect, and others start to experience such people as burdensome.",
    "When they face rejection or abandonment, such people can become impulsive and resort to manipulative behaviour to gain attention and sympathy. Their insistent demands for love and reassurance push others away and only intensify their loneliness."
  ],
  "achievements": [
    "A negative score indicates a dependence on work, where a person views themselves as a product on the job market. The lower the score, the more their joy and capacity for happiness depend on professional achievements.",
    "If such a person goes on holiday with unfinished tasks, retires, or faces illness that prevents them from working, they are at high risk of emotional breakdown. Financial setbacks and emotional shocks are experienced as equally devastating.",
    "A positive score, by contrast, shows that a person finds satisfaction in work but does not regard it as their only source of self-respect and happiness."
  ],
  "impeccability": [
    "The “Perfectionism” scale measures a person’s drive to be flawless in every area. A negative score suggests that the person demands absolute perfection from themselves: mistakes are unacceptable, any failure feels catastrophic, and even difficult emotions can be experienced as the end of the world.",
    "They believe they must think and act perfectly; otherwise, they feel like a total failure. The race toward the ideal becomes an endless process: once one goal is reached, another immediately appears, and the anticipated joy of success never really comes. Life gradually loses its sense of pleasure and enjoyment because of unrealistic personal standards.",
    "A positive score reflects the ability to set realistic goals and enjoy working toward them without fixating solely on the outcome. Such a person understands that they do not have to be perfect in everything and do not need to fear mistakes, seeing them instead as opportunities to learn and grow.",
    "Paradoxically, these people are often more productive than their “perfect” counterparts, because they do not get stuck on every tiny detail. Their life is more like a flowing river, while the life of their perfectionistic friends can resemble “eternal ice”."
  ],
  "label": [
    "A negative score indicates that a person treats things like success, love and happiness as absolute necessities. They expect other people — and even the universe — to welcome them with open arms because of their personal qualities or achievements.",
    "These expectations are often disappointed, which can lead to depression and related problems. Such people spend a lot of energy on worry, resentment and sadness, and large parts of their life start to feel unpleasant and painful.",
    "They tend to complain but do little to actually resolve their difficulties, which ultimately lowers their overall satisfaction with life.",
    "A positive score suggests that a person does not believe they were born for certain special privileges. They do their best to reach their goals and are often successful. They understand that every person is unique and that there is no reason for fate to revolve around their wishes.",
    "Setbacks are seen as manageable disappointments rather than disasters. They do not expect perfection or fairness in everything and at all times. Thanks to patience, persistence and the ability to tolerate frustration, they often move ahead of others."
  ],
  "power": [
    "The “All-Powerfulness” scale reflects a person’s tendency to see themselves as the centre of the universe and to assume responsibility for everything that happens. A negative score points to a cognitive distortion in which a person unreasonably takes on responsibility for events beyond their control. They blame themselves for other people’s behaviour, feel guilty and self-condemning, which leaves them psychologically helpless.",
    "A positive score, on the contrary, shows that a person understands they are not the “centre of the universe” and are not responsible for everyone and everything. This perspective does not distance them from others — it actually helps build healthier relationships.",
    "They relate to others as equals and are not afraid of disagreement. Their fair attitude attracts people, as they do not try to control them. Others are more willing to listen to their ideas because they do not force their opinions on anyone.",
    "They do not chase power, yet people are often ready to entrust it to them. Their relationships with close ones are based on mutuality rather than dependence. As a result, they earn love and respect without trying to dominate."
  ],
  "alone": [
    "The “Autonomy” scale assesses a person’s ability to find joy within themselves. A positive score shows that their moods are shaped mainly by their own thoughts and attitudes. Such a person recognizes responsibility for their feelings, understanding that these experiences arise primarily from their inner world.",
    "They can feel not truly alone, because all their experiences are generated in their own mind. This allows them to explore and appreciate a rich, fascinating inner world.",
    "A negative score, by contrast, indicates that a person believes joy and satisfaction come mainly from the outside world. This is a major disadvantage, because the external world is beyond their control. As a result, their mood becomes completely dependent on external circumstances."
