  "approval": [
    "The \"Approval\" item assesses the tendency to link self-esteem with the opinions of others. A positive score ranging from 0 to 10 indicates that a person possesses independence, a healthy sense of self-worth, responds adequately to criticism, and is not overly influenced by disapproval.",
    "A negative score from -10 to 0 signifies a dependency on how others perceive the individual. In face of criticism, such a person is prone to feeling worthless. Emotional hypersensitivity to others' opinions makes them vulnerable to manipulation."
  ],
  "love": [
    "The \"Love\" item evaluates a person's ability to not be dependent on the love of others. A positive result shows that love, while desired, is not the sole interest in a person's life.",
    "They don't view love as a necessary condition for happiness and self-esteem, making them attractive in others' eyes — they love themselves and are interested in various aspects of life.",
    "A negative score indicates a strong dependence on love, considering it essential for happiness and survival.",
    "The closer the score is to -10, the higher the dependence on love and the stronger the inclination towards a subordinate position out of fear of alienation. This leads to self-disrespect, and others may perceive such individuals as burdensome.",
    "In case of rejection or denial, they become impulsive, resort to manipulation to gain attention and sympathy. Their insistent demand for love and attention leads to pushing others away and intensifying loneliness."
  ],
  "achievements": [
    "A negative result indicates a dependency on work, where a person views themselves as a commodity in the job market. The lower the score, the more their joy and ability to be happy depend on professional achievements.",
    "If such a person takes a vacation leaving unresolved tasks, retires, or faces an illness that hinders work, they risk an emotional breakdown. They perceive economic failures and emotional upheavals equally harshly.",
    "Meanwhile, a positive score indicates that a person finds satisfaction in work, but does not consider it the sole source of self-esteem and happiness."
  ],
  "impeccability": [
    "The item \"Perfectionism\" measures a person's desire for perfection in everything. If the result is negative, the person insists on absolute perfection from himself: mistakes are unacceptable, failure is perceived as a catastrophe, even negative emotions are perceived as the end of the world.",
    "They believe they must act and think perfectly, otherwise, they feel like absolute failures. Chasing ideals becomes an endless process: upon achieving one goal, another emerges, and the expected joy of victory never arrives. Life loses joy and pleasure due to unrealistic personal standards.",
    "A positive score reflects the ability to set reasonable goals and find pleasure in achieving them, not focusing solely on the outcome. Such a person realizes that they don’t have to be perfect in everything and should not fear mistakes, viewing them as opportunities for learning and self-improvement.",
    "Paradoxically, these individuals often end up being more productive than their 'perfect' peers, as they don't focus solely on details. Their life is like the flow of a river, unlike the 'eternal ice' that can describe the lives of those focused on perfection."
  ],
  "label": [
    "A negative score indicates that a person believes things like success, love, and happiness are necessities. They expect the world and others to welcome them with open arms for their personal qualities or achievements.",
    "Often these expectations are unmet, leading to depression and related problems. Such people spend much energy on worries, dissatisfaction, and sorrows, making a large part of their life unpleasant and painful.",
    "They tend to complain but do little to resolve their issues, ultimately reducing their life satisfaction.",
    "A positive result suggests that the person doesn't believe they are entitled to specific things. They strive to achieve what they desire and are often successful. They understand that everyone is unique and there's no reason for fate to comply with their wishes.",
    "Failures are seen as minor disappointments, not tragedies. They don't expect perfection or fairness in everything and always. Thanks to their patience and persistence, and the ability to withstand upsets, they often end up ahead of others."
  ],
  "power": [
    "The \"Omnipotence\" item assesses the tendency of a person to consider themselves the center of the universe and attribute responsibility for everything that happens. A negative result indicates a cognitive distortion where an individual irrationally takes responsibility for events beyond their control. They blame themselves for others' faults, feeling guilt and self-condemnation, leading to psychological helplessness.",
    "Conversely, a positive result shows that the person realizes they are not the 'center of the universe' and do not bear responsibility for everyone and everything. This approach doesn't isolate them from others; rather, it helps establish healthy relationships.",
    "They treat people as equal partners, unafraid of disagreement. Their fair treatment of others attracts them, as they don't try to control them. People listen to their ideas because they don't impose their opinions.",
    "They don't seek power, but people willingly trust them with it. Their relationships with close ones are based on reciprocity, not dependency. Thanks to this, they win the love and respect of others without trying to dominate them."
  ],
  "alone": [
    "The Autonomy item measures a person's ability to find joy in themselves. A positive result indicates that a person's moods are shaped by his or her own thoughts and attitudes. Such a person recognizes responsibility for his or her feelings, realizing that they are generated solely by his or her inner world.",
    "They can feel not lonely, as all their sensations stem from their own mind. This allows them to explore and learn about their fascinating and beautiful inner world.",
    "On the other hand, a negative score shows that a person believes joy and satisfaction come from the external world. This is a significant drawback, as the external world is beyond their control. Consequently, such a person's mood completely depends on external circumstances."
